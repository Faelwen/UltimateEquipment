Light	Haramaki	3 gp	1	—	0	0,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	1 lb.	haramaki	<p>Also called a belly-warmer, a haramaki is a simple silken sash lined with chainmail or articulated metal plates and tied about the stomach to protect it. </p>
Light	Padded	5 gp	1	8	0	5,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	10 lbs.	padded	<p>More than simple clothing, padded armor combines heavy, quilted cloth and layers of densely packed stuffing to create a cheap and basic protection. It is typically worn by those not intending to face lethal combat or those who wish their maneuverability to be impacted as little as possible.</p>
Light	Quilted cloth	100 gp	1	8	0	10,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	15 lbs.	quilted-cloth	<p>This enhanced form of padded armor has internal layers specifically designed to trap arrows, bolts, darts, shuriken, thrown daggers, and other small ranged piercing weapons. When these kinds of weapons strike you, they tend to become snagged in these layers and fail to harm you. Wearing quilted cloth armor gives you DR 3/— against attacks of this kind. The special layers of the armor have no effect on other kinds of weapons. </p>
Light	Silken ceremonial	30 gp	1	—	0	0,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	4 lbs.	silken-ceremonial	<p>Used for ceremonial displays or occasionally worn (albeit with no additional benefit) over heavier armor, these robes consist of several layers of cloth and an outer layer of silk intricately woven with gold brocade designs and covered with metal studs. </p>
Light	Lamellar cuirass	15 gp	2	4	0	5,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	8 lbs.	lamellar-cuirass	<p>This armor consists of a light breastplate and shoulder guards made from lacquered leather plates bound together and fitted over a silk shirt. </p>
Light	Leather	10 gp	2	6	0	10,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	15 lbs.	leather	<p>Leather armor is made up of multiple overlapping pieces of leather, boiled to increase their natural toughness and then deliberately stitched together. Although not as sturdy as metal armor, the flexibility it allows wearers makes it among the most widely used types of armor.</p>
Light	Parade	25 gp	3	5	–1	15,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	20 lbs.	parade	"<p>Most wealthy countries with standing armies have a different uniform for use in showy noncombat situations such as parades, coronation ceremonies, and so on. The appearance of this armor varies by the country of origin and the branch of the military, but still provides some protection in case the soldier needs to fight while in parade dress. For example, one country's parade armor may be a chain shirt, tabard, leather greaves, and a winged helm. If you're wearing a country's parade armor, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href=""/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/skills/diplomacy.html#diplomacy"">Diplomacy</a> and <a href=""/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate"">Intimidate</a> checks to influence a person from that country. Depending on the country, parade armor may be crafted from leather, metal, or a mixture of both.</p>"
Light	Studded leather	25 gp	3	5	–1	15,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	20 lbs	studded-leather	<p>An improved form of leather armor, studded leather armor is covered with dozens of metal protuberances. While these rounded studs offer little defense individually, in the numbers they are arrayed in upon such armor, they help catch lethal edges and channel them away from vital spots. The rigidity caused by the additional metal does, however, result in less mobility than is afforded by a suit of normal leather armor.</p>
Light	Wooden	20 gp	3	3	–1	15,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	25 lbs.	wooden	<p>This suit of leather armor has plates of fire-treated wood sewn over vital areas. Though not as effective as metal armor, it offers better protection than leather alone. Unlike metal armor, the wood is slightly buoyant, and the armor check penalty for swimming in this armor is 0. </p>
Light	Chain shirt	100 gp	4	4	–2	20,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	25 lbs.	chain-shirt	<p>Covering the torso, this shirt is made up of thousands of interlocking metal rings.</p>
Light	Lamellar (leather)	60 gp	4	3	–2	20,00 %	30 ft.	20 ft.	25 lbs.	lamellar-leather	<p>Lamellar is a type of armor in which small plates of various types of materials are strung together in parallel rows using fine cord. Lamellar plates can be constructed from lacquered leather, horn, or even stone, though suits of iron and steel are the most common. Lamellar armor can be crafted into various shapes, including partial pieces such as breastplates, greaves, or even entire coats. The properties of specific suits and pieces of lamellar armor are determined by their material.</p>
Medium	Armored coat	50 gp	4	3	–2	20,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	20 lbs.	armored-coat	"<p>This sturdy leather coat is reinforced with metal plates sewn into the lining. An armored coat is more cumbersome than light armor but less effective than most medium armors. The advantage of it is that a person can don it or remove it as a move action (there is no ""don hastily"" option for an armored coat). If worn over other armor, use the better AC bonus and worse value in all other categories; an armored coat has no effect if worn with heavy armor. The only magic effects that apply are those of armor, clothing, or items worn on top.</p>"
Medium	Hide	15 gp	4	4	–3	20,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	25 lbs.	hide	<p>Hide armor is made from the tanned skin of particularly thick-hided beasts, stitched with either multiple overlapping layers of crude leather or exterior pieces of leather stuffed with padding or fur. Damage to the armor is typically repaired by restitching gashes or adding new pieces of hide, giving the most heavily used suits a distinctively patchwork quality.</p>
Medium	Do-maru	200 gp	5	4	–4	25,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	30 lbs.	do-maru	<p>The lightest of armors typically favored by samurai, do-maru wraps around the wearer's body like a short armored coat. It consists primarily of lamellar and lacks a solid breastplate or sleeves, leaving the shoulders and upper body somewhat exposed, but permitting the wearer greater flexibility than do the majority of heavier armors. </p>
Medium	Kikko	30 gp	5	4	–3	20,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	25 lbs.	kikko	<p>Kikko armor consists of a clever arrangement of hexagonal plates made from iron and sewn to cloth, granting the wearer greater flexibility than that provided by many armors that afford similar defense. The plates may be left exposed or hidden by a layer of cloth.</p>
Medium	Lamellar (horn)	100 gp	5	3	–4	25,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	30 lbs.	lamellar-horn	<p>Lamellar is a type of armor in which small plates of various types of materials are strung together in parallel rows using fine cord. Lamellar plates can be constructed from lacquered leather, horn, or even stone, though suits of iron and steel are the most common. Lamellar armor can be crafted into various shapes, including partial pieces such as breastplates, greaves, or even entire coats. The properties of specific suits and pieces of lamellar armor are determined by their material.</p>
Medium	Scale mail	50 gp	5	3	–4	25,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	30 lbs.	scale-mail	<p>Scale mail is made up of dozens of small, overlapping metal plates. Similar to both splint mail and banded mail, scalemail has a flexible arrangement of scales in an attempt to avoid hindering the wearer's mobility, but at the expense of omitting additional protective layers of armor. A suit of scale mail includes gauntlets.</p>
Medium	Agile breastplate	400 gp	6	3	–4	25,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	25 lbs.	agile-breastplate	"<p>This breastplate is specially crafted in a manner that allows extra maneuverability for some physical activities. The armor check penalty for <a href=""/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/skills/climb.html#climb"">Climb</a> checks and jump checks is only –1 (masterwork and mithral versions of this armor reduce this penalty as well as the normal penalty). </p>"
Medium	Breastplate	200 gp	6	3	–4	25,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	30 lbs.	breastplate	<p>A breastplate protects a wearer's torso with a single piece of sculpted metal, similar to the core piece of a suit of full plate. Despite its sturdiness, its inflexibility and open back make it inferior to complete suits of metal armor, but still an improvement over most non-metal armors.</p>
Medium	Chainmail	150 gp	6	2	–5	30,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	40 lbs.	chainmail	<p>Unlike a chain shirt, which covers only the chest, chainmail protects the wearer with a complete mesh of chain links that cover the torso and arms, and extends below the waist. Multiple interconnected pieces offer additional protection over vital areas. The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
Medium	Four-mirror	45 gp	6	2	–5	30,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	45 lbs.	four-mirror	<p>This armor consists of four plates harnessed together with leather shoulder straps. Two round plates protect your front and back, while two smaller rectangular plates cover the sides of the torso. Four-mirror armor is worn over chainmail to provide added protection, and comes with a spiked helmet with a chainmail hood. </p>
Medium	Lamellar (steel)	150 gp	6	3	–5	25,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	35 lbs.	lamellar-steel	<p>Lamellar is a type of armor in which small plates of various types of materials are strung together in parallel rows using fine cord. Lamellar plates can be constructed from lacquered leather, horn, or even stone, though suits of iron and steel are the most common. Lamellar armor can be crafted into various shapes, including partial pieces such as breastplates, greaves, or even entire coats. The properties of specific suits and pieces of lamellar armor are determined by their material.</p>
Medium	Mountain pattern	250 gp	6	3	–4	30,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	40 lbs.	mountain-pattern	"<p>This medium armor consists of hundreds of small, interlocking pieces of steel shaped to resemble an ancient symbol for the word ""mountain."" The mail is then riveted to a cloth or leather backing. It is worn like a mail coat and covers your torso, shoulders, and thighs. </p>"
Heavy	Banded mail	250 gp	7	1	–6	35,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	35 lbs.	banded-mail	<p>Banded mail is made up of overlapping strips of metal, fastened to a sturdy backing of leather and chain. The size of the metal plates, interconnected metal bands, and layers of underlying armor make it a more significant defense than similar armors, like scale mail or splint mail.</p>
Heavy	Kusari gusoku	350 gp	7	1	–7	35,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	45 lbs.	kusari-gusoku	<p>Kusari gusoku is similar to tatami-do armor; however, a katabira—a type of chain jacket—is worn in place of the chest armor. </p>
Heavy	Lamellar (iron)	200 gp	7	0	–7	40,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	50 lbs.	lamellar-iron	<p>Lamellar is a type of armor in which small plates of various types of materials are strung together in parallel rows using fine cord. Lamellar plates can be constructed from lacquered leather, horn, or even stone, though suits of iron and steel are the most common. Lamellar armor can be crafted into various shapes, including partial pieces such as breastplates, greaves, or even entire coats. The properties of specific suits and pieces of lamellar armor are determined by their material.</p>
Heavy	Splint mail	200 gp	7	0	–7	40,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	45 lbs.	splint-mail	<p>Splint mail is made up of overlapping layers of metal strips attached to a backing of leather or sturdy fabric. These splints are of greater size and durability than those that compose a suit of scale mail, improving the protection they afford the wearer, but at the cost of flexibility. A suit of splint mail includes gauntlets.</p>
Heavy	Tatami-do	1,000 gp	7	3	–6	35,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	45 lbs.	tatami-do	<p>Worn by samurai as a lighter-weight alternative to o-yoroi, tatami-do is a full-body field armor that combines both metal lamellar and kikko components into a suit of mail with a cloth backing. It typically includes a collapsible kabuto helmet or an armored hood, as well as arm, shoulder, and thigh guards. </p>
Heavy	Agile half-plate	850 gp	8	0	–7	40,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	55 lbs.	agile-half-plate	"<p>This style of half-plate is specially crafted in a manner that allows extra maneuverability for some physical activities. The armor check penalty for <a href=""/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/skills/climb.html#climb"">Climb</a> checks and jump checks is only –4 (masterwork and mithral versions of this armor reduce this penalty as well as the normal penalty). In addition, unlike with most heavy armors, the wearer can still run at quadruple speed instead of triple speed. </p>"
Heavy	Half-plate	600 gp	8	0	–7	40,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	50 lbs.	half-plate	<p>Half-plate armor combines elements of full plate and chainmail, incorporating several sizable plates of sculpted metal with an underlying mesh of chain links. While this suit protects vital areas with several layers of armor, it is not sculpted to a single individual's frame, reducing its wearer's mobility even more than a suit of full plate. Half-plate armor includes gauntlets and a helm.</p>
Heavy	Lamellar (stone)	500 gp	8	0	–7	40,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	45 lbs.	lamellar-stone	<p>Lamellar is a type of armor in which small plates of various types of materials are strung together in parallel rows using fine cord. Lamellar plates can be constructed from lacquered leather, horn, or even stone, though suits of iron and steel are the most common. Lamellar armor can be crafted into various shapes, including partial pieces such as breastplates, greaves, or even entire coats. The properties of specific suits and pieces of lamellar armor are determined by their material.</p>
Heavy	O-yoroi	1,700 gp	8	2	–6	35,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	45 lbs.	o-yoroi	"<p>Worn almost exclusively by high-ranking samurai, o-yoroi—or ""great armor""—is a heavy combat armor that consists of various supplementary components that include both plate and lamellar elements. Each suit is crafted for a specific individual and displays the owner's aesthetic. Upon completion, the suit is colored and sealed with a final lacquer finish. The centerpiece of o-yoroi is a cuirass consisting of two parts—a separate reinforcement for the right side called a waidate, and a kikko cuirass. The upper part of the waidate consists of a leather-covered iron plate. The cuirass's leather shoulder straps—called watagami—are likewise armored with metal plates. Affixed to the cuirass are a number of supplementary pieces, including wide lamellar shoulder guards, a kikko sleeve for the shield arm, lacquered iron greaves worn over padded silk leggings, and a groin protector. The signature component of each suit of armor is the tiered kabuto helmet and its accompanying ho-ate mask. Ho-ate masks can be made of hardened leather or metal and are fashioned into fearsome visages such as oni, dragons, or other mythical beings. </p>"
Heavy	Full plate	1,500 gp	9	1	–6	35,00 %	20 ft.	15 ft.	50 lbs.	full-plate	<p>This metal suit comprises multiple pieces of interconnected and overlaying metal plates, incorporating the benefits of numerous types of lesser armor. A complete suit of full plate (or platemail, as it is often called) includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4 × 100) gold pieces. </p>
Heavy	Stoneplate	1,800 gp	9	1	–6	35,00 %	15 ft.	10 ft.	75 lbs.	stoneplate	<p>This armor is crafted by dwarven stonesmiths from alchemically strengthened plates of basalt. Stoneplate is heavy and unwieldy, but offers incredible protection to its wearer. It is primarily used by dwarven druids who cannot wear metal armor.</p>
Shields	Buckler	5 gp	1	—	–1	5,00 %	—	—	5 lbs.	buckler	<p>This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you lose the buckler's AC bonus until your next turn. You can cast a spell with somatic components using your shield arm, but you lose the buckler's AC bonus until your next turn. You can't make a shield bash with a buckler.</p>
Shields	Klar	12 gp	1	—	–1	5,00 %	—	—	6 lbs.	klar	<p>The traditional form of this tribal weapon is a short blade bound to the skull of a large horned lizard, but a skilled smith can craft one entirely out of metal. A traditional klar counts as a light wooden shield with armor spikes; a metal klar counts as a light steel shield with armor spikes.</p>
Shields	Light steel quickdraw shield	59 gp	1	—	–2	5,00 %	—	—	7 lbs.	light-steel-quickdraw-shield	"<p>This light steel shield is specially crafted with a series of straps to allow a character proficient in shields to ready or stow it on her back quickly and easily. If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you may don or put away a quickdraw shield as a swift action combined with a regular move. If you have the <a href=""/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html#two-weapon-fighting"" >Two-Weapon Fighting</a> feat, you can draw a light or one-handed weapon with one hand and a quickdraw shield with the other in the time it would normally take you to draw one weapon. If you have the <a href=""/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html#quick-draw"" >Quick Draw</a> feat, you may don or put away a quickdraw shield as a free action. </p>"
Shields	Light steel shield	9 gp	1	—	–1	5,00 %	—	—	6 lbs.	light-steel-shield	"<p>You strap a light steel shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A light steel shield's weight lets you carry other items in that hand, although you cannot use weapons with it. Whether wooden or steel, a light shield offers the same basic protection and attack benefits, though the two varieties respond differently to some spells and effects (such as rusting grasp). A druid can use a light wooden shield, but not a light steel shield. </p><p><i>Shield Bash Attacks</i>: You can bash an opponent with a light shield. See ""light shield"" in the <a href=""/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateEquipment/armsAndArmor/weapons.html#martial-weapons-table"">Martial Weapons table</a> for the damage dealt by a shield bash with a light shield. Used this way, a light shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a light shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next turn. An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>"
Shields	Light wooden quickdraw shield	53 gp	1	—	–2	5,00 %	—	—	6 lbs.	light-wooden-quickdraw-shield	"<p>A wooden quickdraw shield is essentially the same as a steel quickdraw shield, except it responds differently to some spells and effects (such as <i><a href=""/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/rustingGrasp.html#rusting-grasp"">rusting grasp</a></i>).

Shields	Madu (leather)	40 gp	1	—	–2	5,00 %	—	—	5 lbs.	madu-leather	"<p>The madu is a round, light leather shield with two animal horns—usually from an antelope—extending from opposite edges of the shield. If you are proficient with the madu, you may use it to fight defensively with a –2 penalty instead of the normal –4, and your attack penalty for using <a href=""/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/feats.html#combat-expertise"">Combat Expertise</a> improves by +1 (minimum –1 penalty). You cannot hold anything else in the hand that bears a madu. If you are not proficient with the madu, treat it as a light spiked shield. A madu can't be disarmed. While traditional madus are crafted from leather and animal horn, they can be made entirely out of metal.

A heavy steel shield is so heavy that you can't use your shield hand for anything else.

Shields	Tower shield	30 gp	4	2	–10	50,00 %	—	—	45 lbs.	tower-shield	<p>This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as its user. In most situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to your AC. As a standard action, however, you can use a tower shield to grant you total cover until the beginning of your next turn. When using a tower shield in this way, you must choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge and no cover for attacks that do not pass through this edge (see cover). The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else. </p><p>When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a –2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield's encumbrance.</p>

The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a –4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. (You can't also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.) An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.</p>"
Extras	Locked gauntlet	+8 gp	—	—	Special	N/A	—	—	+5 lbs.	locked-gauntlet	<p>This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily. It provides a +10 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense to keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a locked gauntlet is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. </p><p>The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given applies only if you're wearing a breastplate, light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as part of the armor. </p><p>While the gauntlet is locked, you can't use the hand wearing it for casting spells or employing skills.
