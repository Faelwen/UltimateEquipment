Simple	One-Handed Melee 	Beaststrike club	7300 gp	1d4	1d6	×2	10	3	Bludgeoning		<p>This <i>+1 club</i> is often decorated with large teeth and carved with stylized images of different animals. As a standard action, the wielder may transform the club into the head or limb of an animal; the weapon's damage does not change but the type of damage changes to one of the following to suit the shape of the club: bite (piercing), claw (slashing), gore (piercing), slam (bludgeoning), sting (piercing), or talon (slashing). When transformed, the club counts as a natural weapon and a manufactured weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured or natural weapons. The club also counts as the natural weapon of its current shape for the purpose of feats and spells that rely on specific natural weapons, such as Weapon Focus (bite) or the <i>bloody claws</i> spell. If the wielder has the wild shape ability, she can expend one use of wildshape to increase the weapon's damage by one step for the duration of that wild shape as long as the druid remains in contact with the weapon; if the wielder can wild shape at will, the club's damage is always increased in this fashion.

On a successful hit with the sword against a creature that is the wielder's size or smaller, the wielder can attempt to start a grapple as a free action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

If the target escapes the grapple or the wielder decides to release the target from the grapple, the chain reverts to sword form (with the wielder holding the handle).</p><p>The wielder can also let go of the chain's handle while grappling or pinning the target; if he does so, the chain remains in place and the target gains the entangled condition (Escape Artist DC 20 to slip free, break DC 28, hardness 10, 10 hit points, concentration DC 17 to cast spells while entangled). Another creature can grab the chain's handle as a standard action and will it to revert to sword form as a swift action, which releases the bound creature.

Whenever the wielder of a <i>blade of the rising sun </i>threatens a critical threat (regardless of whether the critical is confirmed or whether the target is subject to critical hits), the target is surrounded by a halo of golden sunlight equivalent to <i>faerie fire </i>until the beginning of the wielder's next turn.

A sacrificial strike converts the wielder's body and spirit into raw energy equivalent to a <i>sunburst </i>(DC 22). Allies of the wielder within the <i>sunburst </i>are not harmed, and the wielder may choose to affect all allies within the <i>sunburst </i>as <i>mass cure light wounds </i>or all allies within 10 feet as <i>breath of life</i>. The caster level for the effects of the sacrificial strike is equal to the sword's caster level plus 1/2 the wielder's level (maximum 25th level).</p><p>A sacrificial strike destroys the wielder's body (as the spell <i>disintegrate</i>), but she has a 50% chance of being reincarnated (as the <i>reincarnate</i> spell) 24 hours after performing a sacrificial strike in a random safe location within 1 mile.

In the hands of a monk, it becomes an instrument of deadly utility. In addition to its more common properties, this weapon can be employed as though the wielder were unarmed: the wielder benefits from feats such as Deflect Arrows or Snatch Arrows (although he can redirect attacks but not catch them if he has no hands free), and a monk treats the blade as a monk weapon for use in his flurry of blows.</p>	3	8	Cost 37,850 gp, craft magic arms and armor, creator must be a monk	moderate transmutation

When attacking a creature that is still bleeding from the <i>bloodthirst dagger</i>'s <i>wounding</i> property, the dagger deals an additional +1 point of damage against the target for each bleeding wound the creature possesses (maximum +10). Whenever the wielder of <i>bloodthirst</i> confirms a critical hit with the weapon, she can choose to deal 1d6 points of additional damage for each still-bleeding wound the target possesses (maximum +5d6 damage). This additional damage is not multiplied by the critical hit, but is in addition to the damage normally added for bleeding wounds. Dealing this damage immediately heals all bleeding wounds possessed by the wielder.</p>	2	10	Cost 30,552 gp, craft magic arms and armor, bleed, inflict serious wounds	moderate evocation

The boulder collapses into rubble and dust at the end of its path or if it encounters an obstacle it cannot break through or roll over, creating a 10-foot-square area of difficult terrain.

Martial	Light Melee 	Ricochet hammer	20301 gp	1d3	1d4	×2	20	2	Bludgeoning		<p>This <i>+1 returning light hammer</i> can strike multiple foes with a single throw. If the wielder has multiple attacks from a high base attack bonus, he may throw the hammer so it rebounds off the first target to strike at a second target, and so on for each of the wielder's additional attacks. The distance to each target adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it to attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target (within three range increments for a -4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the <i>returning</i> property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as <i>true strike</i>) only apply to the first attack and not the others. The ricochet attacks count as the wielder's additional attacks for that round.</p>	1	7	Cost 10,301 gp, craft magic arms and armor, telekinesis	moderate transmutation

Ghosts consumed by a <i>spirit caller</i> still rejuvenate as normal.</p>	1	9	Cost 12,802 gp, craft magic arms and armor, magic jar, plane shift	moderate necromancy
Martial	Two-Handed Melee 	Summoner's sorrow	42816 gp	1d8	1d10	×3		10	Slashing, cold iron	Reach	<p>The <i>summoner's sorrow</i> is a <i>+2 cold iron glaive</i> that deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against summoned creatures, including eidolons. Once each round when the <i>summoner's sorrow</i> damages a summoned or illusory creature, the wielder can make a dispel check as a free action to send away or destroy the creature. This is treated as a <i>dispel magic</i> spell targeted against the spell that created the creature, except that the wielder's base attack bonus is used in place of the wielder's or item's caster level. This ability has no effect on creatures that are called rather than summoned, or on summoned creatures that cannot be dispelled, such as a summoner's eidolon.</p><p>Once per day as a free action, the wielder can attempt a <i>dismissal</i> against a creature damaged by the weapon instead of dispelling it. This ability functions only against extraplanar creatures (whether summoned or not), and works as the spell of the same name with a Will save DC of 17. The wielder cannot both dispel and dismiss in the same round.</p>	2	9	Cost 21,566 gp, craft magic arms and armor, dismissal, dispel magic	moderate abjuration
Martial	Light Melee 	Sun blade	50335 gp	1d8	1d10	19-20/×2		2	Piercing		<p>This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a <i>sun blade</i> is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword. Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.</p><p>In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a <i>+2 bastard sword</i>. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and ×3 on a critical hit instead of the usual ×2).</p><p>The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The <i>sun blade</i> then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging the sword, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by <i>restoration</i> spells) while the sword is wielded.</p>	2	10	Cost 25,335 gp, craft magic arms and armor, daylight, creator must be good	moderate evocation

When the wielder charges an enemy, he receives a +10 foot enhancement bonus to his speed that round.

The sword wielder gains 1d6 temporary hit points each time a negative level is bestowed on another. These temporary hit points last for 24 hours. One day after being struck, subjects must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level gained or any such levels become permanent.</p>	2	17	Cost 13,015 gp, craft magic arms and armor, enervation	strong necromancy

Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Sword of the planes	22315 gp	1d6	1d8	19-20/×2		4	Slashing		<p>This longsword has an enhancement bonus of +1 on the Material Plane, but on any elemental planes its enhancement bonus increases to +2. The +2 enhancement bonus also applies whenever the weapon is used against creatures native to the elemental planes. It operates as a <i>+3 longsword </i>on the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane, or when used against opponents native to either of those planes. On any other plane, or against any outsider, it functions as a <i>+4 longsword</i>.</p>	1	15	Cost 11,315 gp, craft magic arms and armor, plane shift	strong evocation
Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Sylvan scimitar	47315 gp	1d4	1d6	18-20/×2		4	Slashing		<p>When used outdoors in a temperate climate, this +3 scimitar grants its wielder the use of the Cleave feat and deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.</p>	3	11	Cost 23,815 gp, craft magic arms and armor, divine power or creator must be a 7th-level druid	moderate evocation
Ammunition		Tangle bolt	226 gp					0			<p>Often etched with images of spider webs or swampy vines, this sickly green <i>+1 seeking bolt</i> transforms into sticky goo when it hits, entangling its target and becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. In addition to the bolt's damage, the target is entangled as if it had been hit by a tanglefoot bag.</p>	1	12	Cost 113 gp, craft magic arms and armor, true seeing, and either web or creator must have 5 ranks in craft (alchemy)	strong conjuration
Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Ten-ring sword	14315 gp	1d6	1d8	×3		4	Slashing	Monk	<p>This finely crafted <i>+2 nine-ring broadsword </i>has an extra gap at the base of the blade's unsharpened edge, closest to the hilt, seemingly to fit an extra ring. The wielder of a ten-ring sword can use a full-round action to place a magic ring into the empty slot, where the ring then rests until removed (another full-round action). Once a ring is fitted to the tenth slot, the sword's wielder can employ that ring as if he were wearing it, even if he is currently wearing two magic rings.</p><p>Alternatively, the sword's wielder can fit a ring made of a specific metal like adamantine or cold iron into the tenth slot. Doing so allows the sword to penetrate damage reduction as if it were made of the same metal as the ring. Using this property does not grant the weapon any additional properties of that metal (such as bypassing hardness, etc.). Typically, such metal rings cost one-tenth the cost of a nine-ring broadsword made from that material. In the event that a magic ring made from a specific metal, like silver, is affixed to the sword's tenth slot, the sword's wielder decides which of the weapon's two properties will be in effect when the ring is placed. However, the sword's wielder can use a move action to switch between properties. </p>	2	7	Cost 7,157 gp, craft magic arms and armor, mage hand, versatile weapon	moderate transmutation
Firearm ammunition		Tracer bullet	100 gp					0			<p>These <i>+1 firearm bullets</i> deal no damage, but instead cause a pale glow to outline the target, granting the effect of a <i>faerie fire</i> spell and causing the target to take a -2 penalty to AC against ranged attacks.

The wielder can use this effect up to three times per day. The wielder can communicate with the animals as if using a <i>speak with animals</i> spell. Animals that successfully make their saving throws are free of control, but they will not approach within 10 feet of the trident.</p>	1	7	Cost 9,482 gp, craft magic arms and armor, charm animals, speak with animals	moderate enchantment
Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Trident of stability	9815 gp	1d6	1d8	×2	10	4	Piercing	Brace	<p>The base of this sturdy but tarnished <i>+1 trident</i> has a wide metal bar at the bottom, perfectly situated to serve as a solid footrest or other sort of step. The bar acts as an <i>immovable rod</i>, except instead of an activation button, the immobility power triggers whenever the wielder places one or both feet on the bar, and ends whenever the wielder is no longer touching the bar with at least one foot. If the wielder remains in place and steps on the bar, he gains a +10 bonus to his CMD when trying to resist efforts to move him. The wielder is always considered braced against oncoming charge attacks. If the wielder is falling, he may step on the bar as an immediate action to halt his fall, though the sudden jolt means he takes falling damage for the current distance fallen.</p>	1	3	Cost 5,065 gp, craft magic arms and armor, levitate	faint transmutation
Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Trident of warning	10115 gp	1d6	1d8	×2	10	4	Piercing	Brace	<p>A weapon of this type enables its wielder to determine the location, depth, kind, and number of aquatic predators within 680 feet. A <i>trident of warning</i> must be grasped and pointed in order for the character using it to gain such information, and scanning a hemisphere with a radius of 680 feet takes 1 round.

A <i>triton's trident </i>can unleash a <i>hydraulic push </i>three times per day, once from each tine; alternatively, their power can be combined to release a single <i>hydraulic torrent </i>once per day.

Exotic	One-Handed Melee 	Valor's minion	41335 gp	1d8	1d10	19-20/×2		6	Slashing		<p>The blade of this <i>+2 holy bastard sword</i> always appears lustrous and polished, with a hilt wrapped in alternating colors of deep black and royal purple. Effective on its own, a <i>valor's minion</i> is even more potent in the hands of those who dedicate their efforts to vanquishing a single foe. Whenever a wielder uses either the challenge or smite evil class feature, she can sacrifice one additional use of that class feature to treat the smite or challenge as if she were three class levels higher.</p>	2	15	Cost 20,168 gp, craft magic arms and armor, holy smite	strong evocation
Martial	Two-Handed Melee 	Void scythe	95318 gp	1d6	2d4	×4		10	Piercing or slashing	Trip	<p>Instead of a blade, a swathe of absolute darkness inimical to life tips this scythe. It functions as a <i>+1 brilliant-energy scythe</i>, except the blade is formed of negative energy and gives off no light whatsoever. The wielder can channel negative energy directly into the scythe to charge it with life-destroying energy for 1 round per die of channeling. For example, channeling negative energy for 5d6 points of damage fuels the scythe for 5 rounds. While so charged, the <i>void scythe</i> bestows one negative level with each hit. One day after being struck, subjects must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or the negative levels become permanent.</p><p>Black energy utterly consumes any creature that is slain by the <i>void scythe</i>, leaving no body behind but leaving the creature's equipment unharmed.

Whenever the wielder confirms a critical hit with a <i>warbringer, </i>the wielder gains the benefits of <i>rage </i>for 1 round (if a barbarian, the wielder gains 1 additional round of rage for that day), while the creature struck is compelled to move toward and attack its nearest ally with a melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed strike on its next turn (DC 14 Will negates), as the <i>murderous command</i> spell.</p>	3	14	Cost 30,875 gp, craft magic arms and armor, keen edge, murderous command, rage	strong enchantment
