Wondrous Item	Head	Wondrous Item	Head	Helm of brilliance	125000 gp	13	3	<p>This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows:</p><ul><li>Diamond: <i>Prismatic spray</i> (save DC 20)</li><li>Ruby: <i>Wall of fire</i></li><li>Fire opal: <i>Fireball</i> (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half)</li><li>Opal: Daylight</li></ul><p>The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once.

Removing a jewel destroys it.</p><p>If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become <i>prismatic sprays</i> that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line <i>walls of fire</i> extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become <i>fireballs</i> centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.</p>	62,500 gp, craft wondrous item, detect undead, fireball, flame blade, daylight, prismatic spray, protection from energy, wall of fire	strong varied

Three times per day as a free action when casting a spell, the wearer can shift metamagic feats on prepared spells. The wearer can either move a metamagic feat from another prepared spell to a spell being cast or from the spell being cast to another prepared spell.
