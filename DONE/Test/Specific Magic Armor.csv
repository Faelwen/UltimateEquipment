Once per day the wearer of the armor may command the mouths to unleash a torrent of verbal abuse directed against every hostile creature within 60 feet who can see and hear the wearer. Each such creature must make a DC 16 Will saving throw to avoid suffering an overwhelming compulsion to attack the wearer for the next 7 rounds. If the creature is unable to attack the wearer on its next turn, or attacking the wearer would put the creature at risk (moving through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on) it can act normally that turn. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect, and has no effect on creatures that do not use a spoken language.</p>	1	7	7,675 gp, craft magic arms and armor, confusion	moderate enchantment

On command once per day, the wearer can transform it into thick fog that fills his space and provides concealment (20% miss chance). This mist moves with the character. Effects that disperse the mist or destroy it cause the armor to reform into its solid shape on the character's body, as does speaking the command word or entering a place where the fog-magic doesn't function (such as underwater).

The armor itself disappears from view under this coat of scars and the wearer's face appears as a loathsome, eyeless veil of flesh. This change is illusory, similar to <i>glamered </i>armor; however, <i>morlock hide </i>does cause the wearer's arms and legs to extend and her posture to become hunched. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Escape Artist checks, and she can move through narrow spaces while squeezing at normal speed and with no penalty to AC or on attack rolls.</p>	1	10	4,535 gp, craft magic arms and armor, alter self, invisibility	moderate illusion and transmutation

It bestows a commanding aura upon its wearer. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score. Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal, gaining a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against fear.

On command, its wearer can vanish inside the armor, leaving the breastplate behind while she stays safely hidden in an extradimensional space. This space is barely large enough for the wearer to sit comfortably, but does provides breathable air and light to see by. The wearer cannot perceive the environs around the armor while inside. A second command word returns the wearer to the armor's location, wearing the armor. If the wearer can't return to the space the armor is in, she is instead shunted to the nearest empty space that can contain her, but no longer wearing the armor.</p><p>If the breastplate is destroyed, the wearer immediately returns to the square the armor was in when it was destroyed.

Creatures other than the wearer are repulsed by the <i>otyugh armor's </i>vile putridity.</p><p>Any creature ending its turn adjacent to the wearer becomes sickened (Fortitude DC 13 negates) for as long as it remains adjacent to the wearer and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that strikes the wearer with a bite attack is affected the same way, even if it possesses exceptional reach and attacks while not adjacent to the wearer. If the wearer is swallowed whole, the attacker is automatically sickened and must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn or be forced to regurgitate and drop the wearer harmlessly in an adjacent square (though the wearer is knocked prone during the regurgitation). Creatures with the scent ability suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw against the stench of the <i>otyugh armor</i>.

This swarm has statistics identical to an army ant swarm and attacks any creatures within its space. The wearer can command the swarm to move (including changing the shape of the swarm) as a move action, but the swarm must remain adjacent to her. If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, if the wearer is forced to move away from the swarm, or if the wearer commands it to return to her as a move action, the swarm crawls back onto the wearer's torso and returns to armor form.

Its design and coloration are typically suggestive of its related mystery. While wearing the armor, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the armor; for example, a <i>soothsayer's raiment (battlecry)</i> is only usable by an oracle of battle. If the wearer already has that revelation and the revelation grants an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day.

This armor is treated in all ways like medium armor, including when determining proficiency. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +2, and an armor check penalty of -4.</p><p>As a move action, the wearer can snap a strip of wood loose from the armor. The strip lengthens into a weapon of a type chosen by the armor's wearer. It can become a <i>+1 greenwood club</i>, a <i>+1/+1 greenwood quarterstaff</i>, or a <i>+1 keen greenwood wooden stake</i>. If the wearer creates a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the <i>shillelagh</i> spell with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the <i>warden of the woods</i> reduces the armor's enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such weapons can be separated from the armor at any given time. The greenwood weapons keep their enhancement bonuses only while they're in the wearer's hands, though they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders.</p><p>The wearer can reintegrate a weapon back into the <i>warden of the woods</i> as a move action and restore the lost enhancement bonus. Each day at dawn, the armor regenerates any missing strips (regaining its full enhancement bonus), and any weapons still detached from the armor crumble into dust.</p>	3	11	14,850 gp, craft magic arms and armor, ironwood, shillelagh, wood shape	moderate transmutation

The wielder can touch the wall with one hand and command it to revert to a tower shield either resting on the ground and balanced against his hand or strapped to his arm in the normal fashion. The wall has all the characteristics of any other foot-thick wall of masonry (hardness 8, 90 hit points, break DC 35). Attacks sufficient to destroy the wall cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition.

This works as a standard shield bash attack using the wearer's normal attack bonus with the shield, except that the wearer retains the shield bonus to AC, and while the shield's attack is treated as an off-hand attack, the wearer does not take off-hand penalties on her own attacks unless she is fighting with two weapons herself.
