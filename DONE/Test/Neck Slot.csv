Wondrous Item	Neck	Wondrous Item	Neck	Ampoule of false blood	20000 gp	15	0	<p>This necklace consists of a fine gold chain from which hangs a small sealed crystal vial containing preserved liquid blood. Each ampoule is attuned to a specific sorcerer bloodline. If a sorcerer (or other creature with sorcerer bloodline powers, such as from the Eldritch Heritage feat) wears the ampoule for at least one day, she loses her existing bloodline powers and gains the bloodline powers of the ampoule's bloodline, using her sorcerer level to determine the powers gained. The ampoule has no effect on the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged).</p><p>The sorcerer can only use these bloodline powers as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the sorcerer unable to access any bloodline power, either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed.</p><p>As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the sickened condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a sorcerer, her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline powers all permanently change to match those of the ampoule's bloodline. Bonus feats previously selected due to the sorcerer's bloodline are unaffected, but new feats must be selected from the new bloodline's bonus feat list.</p>	10,000 gp, craft wondrous item, limited wish, polymorph, creator must be a sorcerer of the appropriate bloodline	strong transmutation

The crystal can contain a single use of the lay on hands class feature. When filled with this magic, it begins to glow with a pearly white light.

This only affects actual dragons, not all creatures of the dragon type. In addition, if the wearer casts a spell against a dragon, she can roll twice to overcome any spell resistance the dragon might possess, taking the higher result.

Once the wearer has used the power of this amulet for a total of seven nights, the amulet loses its power for one day and the wearer is exhausted for this duration.

Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer make with his hands gain the <i>flaming</i> weapon special ability and are treated as adamantine for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction (but not hardness). The wearer's hands become rigid while using this amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects (unless that manipulation could be accomplished with a club and is not damaged by fire).

A faint blue light limns the wearer, protecting him from attack. Undead creatures are repulsed by this light and take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer of a <i>gravewatch pendant</i>. Incorporeal undead creatures are further repulsed and instead take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer.

(It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is-a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres.
