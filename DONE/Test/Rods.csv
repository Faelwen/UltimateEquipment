Rod		Rod		Earthbind rod	26500 gp	6	5	<p>This rod looks like nothing more than a large, strange sliver of rough granite. This rod's magic interacts with stone or earth to both steady its wielder and anchor creatures the rod touches. An <i>earthbind rod</i> functions like a <i>+1 light mace</i>, and it grants its wielder a +4 circumstance bonus to its CMD against bull rush, grapple, overrun, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, but only if the wielder is an oread, has the earth subtype, or is standing on earth or stone.

Rod		Rod		Fiery nimbus rod	22305 gp	6	3	<p>This rod functions as a <i>+1 flaming burst light mace</i>. Furthermore, when the rod confirms a critical hit, not only does it deal the extra damage from the <i>flaming burst</i> special ability, a nimbus of cold blue flames ignites the target for 1d4 rounds. This illuminates the target as the faerie fire spell. While the nimbus does not burn the target, it responds to melee attacks made against that foe. Each time an ignited foe takes damage from a melee attack, it takes and additional 1d10 fire damage.</p><p>Furthermore, once per day, as a free action, after hitting a foe with this rod, the wielder can surround the target of that attack with the nimbus, which has the same effect as the nimbus created by a confirmed critical hit.</p>	11,305 gp, craft wondrous item, flame blade, flame strike or fireball, fairy fire	moderate evocation
Rod		Rod		Grounding rod	12000 gp	5	10	<p>This 6-foot-long silver rod is capped with a copper ball at one end, and a multipronged iron spike at the other. Three times per day, the spiked end can be driven into sand, mud, or loose earth as a move action, into dense soil or loose gravel as a standard action, or into stone or harder materials as a full-round action. Once anchored, the rod emits a field that inhibits electrical charges within a 40-foot radius. All creatures within this radius gain resistance 5 to electricity, and anyone attempting to cast a spell with the electricity descriptor must make a caster level check (DC 16) or lose the spell.</p><p>Removing the rod from the ground and deactivating it requires the same type of action as anchoring it.</p>	6,000 gp, craft rod, dispel magic, lightning bolt, resist energy	faint abjuration
Rod		Rod		Immovable rod	5000 gp	10	5	<p>This rod looks like a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Several <i>immovable</i> rods can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An immovable rod can support up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes against an <i>immovable</i> rod, it must succeed at a DC 30 Strength check to move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round.</p>	2,500 gp, craft rod, levitate	moderate transmutation
Rod		Rod		Liberator's rod	30000 gp	9	5	<p>This bronze rod is capped with a hollow head formed by sweeping aquiline wings shielding a <i>continual flame. </i>A <i>rod of liberty </i>can be used as a <i>+1 merciful light mace</i>, but while its merciful property is suppressed by the wielder so is the <i>continual flame. </i>On command, the wielder of a <i>rod of liberty </i>may touch a creature that has failed a save against a charm, compulsion, or possession effect. Doing so grants that creature a new saving throw to end the effect. If this new save fails, the effect remains and the rod's touch cannot further affect it.</p><p>Once per day on command, the wielder can use <i>break enchantment</i>, as the spell.</p>	15,000 gp, craft magic arms and armor, craft rod, break enchantment, cast out, continual flame	moderate abjuration
Rod		Rod		Rod of absorption	50000 gp	15	5	<p>This rod absorbs spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character holding the rod or her gear. The rod then nullifies the spell's effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.</p><p>A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared without expending the prepared spell itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.</p><p>A <i>rod of absorption</i> can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy.</p><p>To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: on a result of 71-100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within.</p>	25,000 gp, craft rod, spell turning	strong abjuration
Rod		Rod		Rod of alertness	85000 gp	11	4	<p>This rod is indistinguishable from a <i>+1 light mace</i>. The rod bestows a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks.

Each different use is a standard action.</p><p>If the head of a <i>rod of alertness</i> is planted in the ground and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creatures within 120 feet that intend to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a <i>prayer</i> spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of any unfriendly creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an <i>animate objects </i>spell, utilizing any 11 (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated for 11 rounds.

However, when the wielder pushes a small button on one end of the rod (a move action), the rod springs open to a 5-foot length, and its powers become available for use.</p><p>Once extended, the rod possesses several powers that add to the wielder's acrobatic abilities. The wielder of the rod receives a +10 competence bonus on all Acrobatics checks involving long jumps and high jumps; additionally, the wielder covers double the normal distance for a jump when making an Acrobatics check. The individual holding the rod also gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2 bonus.

Rod		Rod		Rod of cancellation	11000 gp	17	5	<p>This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. The item touched must make a successful DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder's is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the rod becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle </i>spell. If a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> and a <i>rod of cancellation</i> negate each other, nothing can restore either of them.</p>	5,500 gp, craft rod, mage's disjunction	strong abjuration

The dire flail is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon's heads can be used to attack. The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks at a -2 penalty (as if she had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat).</p><p>Once per day, the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes.

The <i>rod of lordly might</i> is metal and thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. Pushing any of the rod's buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, and the rod weighs 10 pounds.</p><p>The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.</p><ul><li>Use <i>hold person</i> upon a touched creature, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates).

As the wearer aims the rod, the pulsations grow more noticeable as it points to the largest mass of metal within 30 feet. However, the wielder can also concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. If the specific mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places it is located, and the rod wielder knows the approximate quantity as well.

The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod's wielder needs to have a readied action.

The climate is comfortable for all creatures present. Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all creatures touching the rod to be transported instantaneously to the paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain physical contact, allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17 Will save to negate the effect. If an unwilling creature succeeds at its save, other creatures beyond that point in a chain can still be affected by the rod.</p><p>When the rod's effect expires, is dismissed, or is dispelled, all the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for reentry.

Rod		Rod		Rod of thunder and lightning	33000 gp	9	5	<p>Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a <i>+2 light mace</i>. Its other powers are as follows.</p><ul><li><b>Lightning</b>: Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a <i>+2 light mace</i> (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod fails to score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still apply. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.</li><li><b>Lightning Stroke</b>: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide <i>lightning bolt</i> dealing 9d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 16 half) to a range of 200 feet.</li><li><b>Thunder</b>: Once per day, the rod can strike as a <i>+3 light mace</i>, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this sonic power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.</li><li><b>Thunderclap</b>: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a <i>shout</i> spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds).</li><li><b>Thunder and Lightning</b>: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap power with a <i>lightning bolt</i>, as in the lightning stroke power. The thunderclap affects all creatures within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.</li></ul>	16,500 gp, craft magic arms and armor, craft rod, lightning bolt, shout	moderate evocation
Rod		Rod		Rod of thunderous force	5400 gp	9	5	<p>This mahogany rod is etched with the image of whirling storm clouds. Once per day on command, the wielder can slam the rod against the ground, releasing a concussive wave of sonic and force energy. This creates a 20-foot radius burst centered on the wielder. While it causes no damage, those within the burst must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or fall prone and be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The wielder is unaffected by this blast. This effect is a force and sonic effect.</p>	2,700 gp, craft rod, blindness/deafness, wall of force	moderate evocation

If she scores a critical hit, the damage from that hit is permanent ability drain. In either case, the defender negates the effect with a DC 17 Fortitude save.</p>	12,500 gp, craft magic arms and armor, craft rod, contagion	strong necromancy

Rod		Rod		Suzerain scepter	20000 gp	7	5	<p>This ornately bejeweled baton confers the mark of rightful rulership on its bearer. The wielder of this scepter gains a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge (nobility) and Diplomacy checks.

In addition, a <i>suzerain scepter </i>radiates a continuous <i>bless </i>effect that affects any cohort, follower, animal companion, familiar, special mount, or creature charmed or summoned by the wielder (but not called creatures or those under <i>dominate</i> or other compulsion effects).

Rod		Rod		Trap-stealer's rod	13500 gp	15	5	<p>This sturdy iron rod is forged with pronounced angles to allow for strong gripping, inscribed with images and sayings of trickster figures from myths and common folklore. Hooked at one end, a trap-stealer's rod functions as an exceptional crowbar, granting the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to force open a door or chest when using it to do such.</p><p>In addition, on command, the wielder can transform the rod into a magical set of thieves' tools. Using these grant a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. The wielder can transform these tools into the rod again with a command.</p><p>Lastly, if the rod's bearer successfully disables a trap with the thieves' tools and beats the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, he can magically steal the disabled trap. A stolen trap disappears from the surrounding area, siphoned into extradimensional space that is connected to the rod. Terrain around the trap reworks itself as if the trap never had existed, though doorways and portals that supported a trap remain unaffected. At any time during the next 24 hours, the rod's wielder can place the stored trap in a new location where it operates as normal. The new location must be able to support the trap's placement; for example a stolen pit trap could be taken from a dungeon floor and replaced on a dirt road, but not upon the surface of a river or lake, and the effectiveness of the placement is subject to GM discretion. Placing a stolen trap into a location that does not support it wastes the effect and magically transports the trap back to its original location. Whether successfully placed into a new location or not, a stolen trap returns to its original location after 24 hours. This ability functions once per day.</p>	6,750 gp, craft rod, create pit, knock, plane shift	strong transmutation
