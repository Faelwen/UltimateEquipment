It holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. For example, a lawful good paladin gains access to the lawful and good powers, but a neutral cleric gains access to no powers. All of these are command-word activated.</p><p><i>Chaotic (violet flame): Word of chaos</i> once per day on command.</p><p><i>Good (white flame):</i> Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the benefits of <i>protection from evil</i> and <i>heroism</i>.</p><p><i>Evil (black flame):</i> Bearer is constantly under the effect of <i>protection from good</i> and may use <i>harm</i> twice per day.</p><p><i>Lawful (golden flame): Dictum</i> once per day on command.</p>	The beacon of true faith is destroyed if its bearer turns against the worship of his deity to willingly embrace an opposite alignment.	strong (all schools)

When the <i>crown of the iron king</i> is placed on a creature's head, these spikes burrow violently inward. The wearer becomes the thrall of the creature who placed the crown on it for as long as it wears the crown. The crown must be placed on either a willing or unconscious creature, which takes a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Taking off the crown also takes a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity and can be taken only by the creature who put the crown on the wearer, or at the command of that creature.

Artifact	Minor	Artifact	Minor	Deck of many things		20	0	<p><b>Slot: </b> None</p><p>A <i>deck of many things </i>is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.</p><p>The character with a <i>deck of many things </i>who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards.</p><p>Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A <i>deck of many things </i>contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are clarified below.</p><p><i>Balance</i>: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level.</p><p><i>Comet</i>: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level.</p><p><i>Donjon</i>: This card signifies imprisonment-either by the <i>imprisonment</i> spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards.</p><p><i>Euryale</i>: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent.</p><p><i>The Fates</i>: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.</p><p><i>Flames</i>: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.</p><p><i>Fool</i>: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester.</p><p><i>Gem</i>: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each. </p><p><i>Idiot</i>: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional.</p><p><i>Jester</i>: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional.</p><p><i>Key</i>: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand.</p><p><i>Knight</i>: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the Leadership feat.</p><p><i>Moon</i>: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of <i>wishes </i>shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of <i>wishes </i>(full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These <i>wishes </i>are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.</p><p><i>Rogue</i>: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.</p><p><i>Ruin</i>: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost.</p><p><i>Skull</i>: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone-if others help, dread wraiths appear to fight them as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i>.</p><p><i>Star</i>: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. </p><p><i>Sun</i>: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.</p><p><i>Talons</i>: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck.</p><p><i>Throne</i>: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).</p><p><i>Vizier</i>: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely.</p><p><i>The Void</i>: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment.

A character's ability to gain control of a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action).

Several smaller lenses of similar design hover around the primary lens like a bizarre orrery, moving into place to focus the arcane rays of the device. The <i>celestial lens</i> was created to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars.</p><p>Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely powerful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing light focused directly below the celestial lens. Depending on the will of the controller and GM adjudication for inclement weather, such blasts deal between 5d6 and 20d6 points of damage in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the lens to the ground or target. During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round.

It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the <i>flame of guidance</i>. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around its temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below. The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning.

Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. </p><p>In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities.</p><ul><li>Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability.</li><li><i>Guards and wards</i> 1/day on the central tower.</li><li><i>Storm of vengeance</i> 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet).</li><li><i>Wind wall</i> at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.</li></ul>	The Cloud Castle of the Storm King can only be destroyed if it is dissipated by suitably strong winds; the only winds that can dissipate it are found only in the most turbulent reaches of the Plane of Air (of course, as nobody knows how to make it travel between planes, those wishing to destroy it must find it on the Plane of Air to have any chance to do so). Any other attacks may cause walls to collapse or even side towers to break loose, but the central chamber and the floors beneath it will continue to exist in a ruined form over a smaller storm cloud as long as this destruction condition is not met.	strong (all schools)

She can dominate any other possessor of an <i>Orb</i> within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates).</li><li><i>Green Dragon Orb</i>: <i>Spectral hand</i>.</li><li><i>Red Dragon Orb</i>: <i>Wall of fire</i>.</li><li><i>Silver Dragon Orb</i>: <i>Cure critical wounds</i> (Will DC 18 half).</li><li><i>White Dragon Orb</i>: <i>Protection from energy  (cold)</i> (Fortitude DC 17 negates).</li></ul>	An Orb of Dragonkind immediately shatters if it is caught in the breath weapon of a dragon who is a blood relative of the dragon trapped within. This causes everyone within 90 feet to be struck by the breath weapon of that dragon, released as the orb explodes.	strong enchantment
Artifact	Major	Artifact	Major	Perfection's key		16	0.5	<p><b>Slot: </b> None</p><p>This platinum key can open nearly any lock or door with a mere touch. With a touch of the key, a lock of DC 40 or lower unlocks. When a creature holding the key attempts to break down a door with a break (locked) DC of 28 or lower, the door is broken and opened. In all other cases it grants the creature possessing <i>Perfection's Key</i> a +10 bonus on Disable Device checks to pick locks, and a +10 bonus on attempts to break down doors. </p>	Somewhere in the planes there is said to be an Impossible Lock-a mechanism so perfect that only this key can thwart it. If Perfection's Key is inserted into the Impossible Lock, the key is destroyed, but unlocks the Impossible Lock.	strong transmutation
Artifact	Major	Artifact	Major	The shadowstaff		20	1	<p><b>Slot: </b> None</p><p>This artifact was crafted ages ago, weaving together wispy strands of shadow into a twisted black staff. The <i>Shadowstaff </i>makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and on Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The <i>Shadowstaff</i> also has these powers.</p><ul><li><i>Summon Shadows</i>: Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a <i>summon monster V</i> spell cast at 20th level.</li><li><i>Summon Nightshade</i>: Once per month, the staff can summon an advanced shadow demon that serves the wielder as if called by a <i>summon monster IX</i> spell cast at 20th level.</li><li><i>Shadow Form</i>: Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by <i>gaseous form</i>. </li><li><i>Shadow Bolt</i>: Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.</li></ul>	The Shadowstaff fades away to nothingness if it is exposed to true sunlight for a continuous 24 hour period.	strong conjuration
Artifact	Major	Artifact	Major	The shield of the sun		20	2	<p><b>Slot: </b> None</p><p>This <i>+5 Large shield</i>, emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Charisma of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day the character might have, even from paladin class levels. The <i>Shield of the Sun</i> also grants its wielder spell resistance 15. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest at the behest of a lawful good deity (no saving throw to avoid). </p><p>A chaotic or evil character gains four negative levels when wielding the <i>Shield of the Sun</i>. The negative levels persist as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including <i>restoration</i> spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's possession.</p>	The Shield of the Sun may be destroyed if a good-aligned character casts it into the Well of Eternal Night, its light fading into the inky depths before it finally disappears. If a nongood character does the deed, the shield is not destroyed, merely lost, and a quest to the Plane of Shadow may recover it.	strong abjuration
Artifact	Major	Artifact	Major	Skullsoul		18	8	<p><b>Slot: </b> None</p><p>This grim, alabaster figurine is the size of a human skull with an elaborately sculpted base. The <i>Skullsoul</i> is inert until it is bonded with a living creature. It then becomes a powerful and never-questioning companion. The <i>Skullsoul</i> functions as a demilich without the devour soul, rejuvenation, telekinetic storm, and torpor abilities, and with a hardness of 10. It is under the complete control of whoever bonds with the skull. Bonding with the <i>Skullsoul</i> is a ritual that takes 24 hours to perform, and doing so is an evil act. Paladins and good clerics who do so become ex-paladins and ex-clerics respectively. If they wish to atone, they must intercede with their deities (expending 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings) and must promise to contain the skull.</p>	The Skullsoul cannot be destroyed but it can be contained. As long as the Skullsoul stays pierced by either a weapon with the vorpal special ability or a holy avenger, it is contained and entirely inert until the sword is removed.	strong necromancy
