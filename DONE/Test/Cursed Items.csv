Cursed Item		Cursed Item		-2 cursed sword		15	4	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This longsword performs well against targets in practice, but when used in combat its wielder takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls.</p><p>All damage dealt is also reduced by 2 points, but never below a minimum of 1 point of damage on any successful hit. The sword always forces that character to employ it rather than another weapon. The sword's owner automatically draws it and fights with it even when she meant to draw or ready some other weapon.</p>	+2 longsword, any magic weapon	strong evocation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Amulet of inescapable location 		10	0.5	<p><b>Slot: </b>neck</p><p>This device appears to prevent location, scrying and detection, or influence by <i>detect thoughts</i> or telepathy, as per an <i>amulet of proof against detection and location</i>. Actually, the amulet gives the wearer a -10 penalty on all saves against divination spells.</p>	amulet of proof against detection and location	moderate abjuration
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Armor of arrow attraction 		16	50	<p><b>Slot: </b>Armor</p><p>Magical analysis indicates that this armor is a normal suit of <i>+3 full plate. </i>The armor works normally with regard to melee attacks but actually attracts ranged weapons. The wearer takes a -15 penalty to AC against ranged weapons. The true nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is fired upon in earnest.</p>	 +3 full plate	strong abjuration
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Armor of rage 		16	50	<p><b>Slot: </b>Armor</p><p>This armor is similar in appearance to <i>armor of command </i>and functions as a suit of <i>+1 full plate</i>. However, when it is worn, the armor causes the character to take a -4 penalty to Charisma. All unfriendly creatures within 300 feet gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against her. The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected. In other words, the wearer does not immediately notice that donning the armor is the cause of her problems, nor do foes understand the reason for the depth of their enmity.</p>	armor of command, +1 full plate	strong necromancy
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Arrowbreak bow		6	2	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This shortbow is beautifully made and inlaid with iridescent designs, appearing to be a <i>+2 shortbow</i>. When it fires its arrows, though, it does it with so much force that the arrows are always broken on either a hit or a miss. This bow must be used as its owner's primary ranged weapon and can only be discarded after the owner is subject to a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar effect.</p>	+2 shortbow	moderate evocation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Bag of devouring 		17	15	"<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a <i>bag of holding</i>. The sack, however, is something entirely different and more insidious-one of the feeding orifices of an extradimensional creature.</p><p>Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to ""swallowing'' if thrust within the bag. The <i>bag of devouring </i>is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending appendage and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature, it pulls the victim inside as a free action. The bag has a CMD of 18 for those attempting to break free.</p><p>The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a <i>bag of holding  type I</i>, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising orresurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a <i>wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>true  resurrection</i> spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.</p>"	bag of holding (any type)	strong conjuration
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Belt of weakness		8	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>belt</p><p>Appearing to be a wide leather belt that functions as a <i>belt of mighty constitution +4</i>, this belt in fact saps the wearer's health rather than supplement it. A <i>belt of weakness </i>confers a -4 penalty to its wearer's Constitution score. Furthermore, when the wearer rolls a natural 1 on any Fortitude save, the belt constricts, dealing 2d8 points of damage. </p>	belt of mighty constitution (any)	moderate transmutation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Berserking sword		8	8	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This sword appears to be a <i>+2 greatsword. </i>However, whenever it is used in battle, its wielder goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage ability). He attacks the nearest creature and continues to fight until unconscious or dead or until no living thing remains within 30 feet. Although many see this sword as a cursed object, others see it as a boon.</p>	+2 greatsword, any magic weapon	moderate evocation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Biting battleaxe		8	6	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This vicious-looking <i>+2 battleaxe</i> grants its wielder the Great Cleave feat. But when using this feat, the wielder makes an additional attack against a random adjacent creature instead of choosing which creature to attack. When determining which creature is attacked, the wielder always counts himself as a possible target, even if he is not adjacent to the target. The wielder of a <i>biting battleaxe</i> must always uses it as his primary weapon and must use Great Cleave at every opportunity until subject to a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar effect. </p>	+2 battleaxe	moderate evocation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Boots of dancing 		16	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>feet</p><p>These boots appear and initially function as one of the other kinds of magic boots. When the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee combat, <i>boots of dancing </i>impede movement, making him behave as if <i>irresistible dance</i> had been cast upon him. Only a <i>remove curse</i> spell enables the wearer to be rid of the boots once their true nature is revealed. </p>	boots of elvenkind, boots of levitation, boots of speed, boots of striding and springing, boots of teleportation, boots of the winterlands, winged boots	strong enchantment
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Bracers of defenselessness 		16	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>wrists</p><p>These bejeweled and shining bracers initially appear to be <i>bracers of armor  +5 </i>and actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by an enemy with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than her level. At that moment and thereafter, the bracers bestow a -5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is activated, <i>bracers of defenselessness </i>can be removed only by means of a <i>remove curse</i> spell.</p>	bracers of armor +5	strong conjuration
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Broom of animated attack 		10	3	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This item is indistinguishable from a normal broom. It is identical to a <i>broom of flying</i> by all tests short of attempted use.</p><p>If a creature attempts to fly using the broom, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage, since the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim, swatting his face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end. The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and two with the handle, for a total of four attacks per round). It attacks with a +5 bonus on each attack roll. The straw end causes a victim to be blinded for 1 round when it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom has AC 13, CMD 17, 18 hit points, and hardness 4.</p>	broom of flying	moderate transmutation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Buffoon's sword 		10	2	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This blade seems to be and behaves in all ways as a <i>sword of subtlety</i> until actually used in combat. Once used in combat, it imposes a -10 penalty on all Stealth checks made by its wielder. It also makes it nearly impossible for the owner to tell a lie or engage in any other sort of subterfuge. Each time he does so, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid blurting out the truth or taking some other involuntary action that spoils his attempted ruse. Only curse-ending magic can rid the wielder of the sword once its curse activates.</p>	sword of subtlety	moderate divination
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Cape of anchoring		9	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>shoulders</p><p>This bright red and gold cape appears to be a <i>cape of the mountebank</i>. Once worn, however, it affects its wearer as if subject to a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell. The cape can only be removed after its wearer is subject to a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar effect.</p>	cape of the mountebank	moderate abjuration
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Cannibal ring 		16	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>ring</p><p>This simple and unadorned copper ring appears slightly tarnished, but seemingly wards off the effects of hunger or other sorts of deprivation; all tests reveal it to be a <i>ring of sustenance</i>. However, after wearing it for 7 days, its owner instead comes to suffer from almost constant hunger and thirst, which, if not sated, ultimately drives him mad enough to become a cannibal. The wearer must eat and drink a full day's worth of food and water each hour to avoid making a starvation or thirst check. Once the wearer starts to take lethal damage instead of nonlethal damage due to failed checks, he begins to experience ever more powerful cravings for the flesh of intelligent creatures (any living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher).</p><p>Once the wearer feasts in such a manner, he recovers all nonlethal damage sustained from hunger and thirst, though he continues to suffer lethal damage on failed starvation and thirst checks. The next time he is in a situation in which he could eat part of an intelligent being, he must make a DC 15 Will save or dine on the forbidden meat. If the wearer succumbs to this urge again, he recovers all lethal damage from failed starvation and thirst checks, and realizes cannibalism is the key to avoiding the increased hunger and thirst-on any day he eats at least one meal of flesh from an intelligent creature, he does not have to make hourly starvation and thirst checks, and recovers any accumulated damage from failing these checks. Once its curse activates, the ring cannot be removed until the curse is broken.</p>	ring of sustenance	strong transmutation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Cloak of immolation		12	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>shoulders</p><p>This cloak appears to be a finely made garment that radiates protective magic. The cloak can be handled or examined without harm, but when it is put on, it immediately bursts into flames that burn continuously but do not harm the cloak, only its wearer. The cloak deals 1d6 points of fire damage each round and cannot be removed unless the curse is broken. Sufficient amounts of water or other smothering materials can douse the flames temporarily, but the cloak reignites when exposed to air again. Spells like <i>resist energy</i>, <i>protection from energy</i>, and similar effects can protect the wearer against the cloak's flames while they last.</p>	any cloak	strong evocation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Crown of blindness		10	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>headband</p><p>This fine silver circlet is often set with a milky moonstone. When a wearer places it on his head, the stone quickly goes dark like the waning moon, and the wearer must make a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or immediately go blind. The saving throw must be made each round that the crown is worn until the wearer succumbs to the blindness. Removing the circlet requires breaking the curse. In addition to a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar effect, <i>remove blindness/deafness</i> can be used to end the circlet's curse long enough to remove the item.</p>	headband of alluring charisma, headband of inspired wisdom, headband of mental prowess, headband of mental superiority, headband of vast intelligence, moon circlet	moderate illusion
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Crystal hypnosis ball		17	7	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This cursed scrying device is at first glance indistinguishable from a normal <i>crystal ball . </i>However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes fascinated for 1d6 minutes, and a telepathic <i>suggestion</i> is implanted in her mind (Will DC 19 negates).</p><p>The user of the device believes that she viewed the desired creature or scene through the ball, but she actually came under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the <i>crystal hypnosis ball</i>'s gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a servant or a tool. Note that throughout this time, the user remains unaware of her subjugation. </p>	crystal ball	strong divination
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Cursed backbiter spear		10	3	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This is a <i>+2 shortspear, </i>but each time it is used in melee against a foe and the attack roll is a natural 1, it damages its wielder instead of her intended target. When the curse takes effect, the spear curls around to strike its wielder in the back, automatically dealing the damage to the wielder. The curse even functions when the spear is hurled, and in such a case the damage to the hurler is doubled. </p>	+2 shortspear, any magic weapon	moderate evocation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Deadly returns throwing axe		8	2	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This weapon appears to be a <i>+2 returning throwing axe</i>. Instead of the normal returning ability, this axe only returns when the wielder misses her target. When it does return, it attacks the wielder. It uses the wielder's full base attack bonus with this attack. If it hits, it sticks in the wielder, and the wielder can pull out the axe with a swift action. If it misses the wielder, it falls to a random unoccupied square adjacent to the wielder and must be picked up as soon as possible. The wielder of the <i>deadly returns throwing axe</i> always uses it as her primary weapon until subject to a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar effect. </p>	+2 returning throwing axe	moderate evocation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Drums of lethargy		5	5	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This set of kettle drums appears to be <i>drums of haste</i>. When a creature plays the drums, it affects all creatures (including the creature playing the drums) as though subject to a <i>slow </i>spell. A DC 14 Will save negates the effect. No Perform check is needed to create the <i>slow</i> effect. </p>	drums of haste	faint transmutation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Dust of sneezing and choking 		7	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This fine dust appears to be <i>dust of appearance . </i>If cast into the air, it causes those within a 20-foot spread to fall into fits of sneezing and coughing. Those who fail a DC 15 Fortitude save take 3d6 points of Constitution damage immediately. Those who succeed on this saving throw are nonetheless disabled by choking (treat as stunned) for 5d4 rounds.</p>	dust of appearance, dust of tracelessness	moderate conjuration
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Eyes of blindness		5	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>Eyes</p><p>These normal-looking glasses appear harmless and nondescript.

Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Flask of curses		7	2	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This item looks like an ordinary beaker, bottle, container, decanter, flask, or jug. It may contain a liquid, or it may emit smoke. When the flask is first unstoppered, all creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or be cursed, taking a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until a <i>remove curse</i> spell is cast upon them.</p>	decanter of endless water, efreeti bottle, eversmoking bottle, iron flask	moderate conjuration
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Gauntlets of fumbling		7	2	<p><b>Slot: </b>hands</p><p>These gauntlets perform according to their appearance until the wearer finds herself under attack or in a life-and-death situation. At that time, the curse is activated. The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a 50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower the wearer's Dexterity score by 2 points. Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a <i>remove curse</i> spell, a <i>wish , </i>or a <i>miracle .</i></p>	gauntlet of rust, gloves of arrow snatching, glove of storing, gloves of swimming and climbing	moderate transmutation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Girdle of opposite gender		10	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>belt</p><p>When this magical belt is put on, the wearer must immediately make a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or be transformed into a person of the opposite gender. The character's abilities, mind, and spirit remain unaffected; only the character's sex changes. If the character's saving throw is a natural 1, the item actually removes all gender from the wearer, giving him an androgynous, neutered appearance. The change is permanent unless undone with curse-removing magic. Once its magic takes effect, the belt can be removed without effort. A creature can only be affected by a particular girdle once, though other girdles of this type can cause further transformations.</p>	any belt	moderate transmutation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Gravesoul armor		10	20	"<p><b>Slot: </b>armor</p><p>This armor behaves in all ways as if it were <i>+1 undead controlling studded leather</i> until its owner actually attempts to use its special property. At that point, the wearer and all living creatures within a 20-foot radius must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid believing that they are actually some sort of undead creature for the next 24 hours. The GM can either roll randomly (1d6; 1-3 zombies, 4-5 ghouls, 6 vampires) or choose which sorts of specific undead the affected creatures believe themselves to be. Creatures affected by the armor behave as normal for the sorts of undead they regard themselves as-""zombies"" mindlessly attack unassociated creatures near them, vampires attempt to bite victims on the neck, and so on-but gain none of the special abilities of that creature. The affected creatures react negatively to effects that harm ""their"" type of undead, so ""vampires"" avoid garlic, ""wraiths"" recoil from sunlight, and so on. The creatures continue to believe they are actually undead and ignore all evidence to the contrary. If attacked, they defend themselves, even if this requires using abilities they have but ""their"" type of undead normally lacks; for example, a barbarian who thinks she's a ghoul can still rage. Channel energy and other undead-affecting effects have no effect on creatures affected by <i>gravesoul armor</i>.</p><p>This is a mind-affecting, compulsion enchantment. The wearer of the armor can use this power up to three times per day, though it can only work on a particular creature once in any 24-hour period. Regardless of the curse, the armor is still <i>+1 studded leather</i>, and some characters may find it useful despite its (nonexistent) power over undead. Unlike most cursed items, this one is easily discarded without any magical assistance.</p>"	+1 undead controlling studded leather	moderate enchantment
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Hat of hatreds		10	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>head</p><p>This hat performs in all ways like a <i>hat of disguise</i> until its owner attempts to use it to disguise himself in the presence of a hostile creature. Once he does, the hat causes him to assume the guise of the creature or person the hostile creature most wants to harm. The hat never causes the wearer to assume the appearance of someone the viewer wouldn't harm if he had the opportunity (for example, the greatly feared leader of the local temple).</p><p>Once the hat reveals its true abilities, it no longer responds to attempts by its wearer to change his appearance. Instead, it automatically causes him to take on the guise of someone known to and despised by those viewing him, complete with supplementary illusions that make that wearer appear disoriented, injured, or weak. For example, in a goblin lair, the wearer might look like the tribe's chief, but sleepy and vulnerable. In a human town, the wearer may look like the hated local bully, drunk and staggering. In an evil town, the wearer looks like a confused visitor and appears to be an ideal target to victimize with some crime.</p><p>Curse-breaking magic is necessary to remove the hat.</p>	hat of disguise	moderate illusion
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Headband of stupidity		8	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>headband</p><p>This headband appears to be a <i>headband of vast intellect +4</i>, but instead of granting a +4 bonus to Intelligence and bonuses to associated skills, the wearer take a -4 penalty to Intelligence and a further -2 penalty on all Knowledge checks. The wearer is not aware of the debilitating effects of the headband; even the stupidest statement or misguided insight seems intelligent to him while he is wearing it. </p>	headband of vast intellect +4	strong transmutation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Heavy hammer		8	20	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This massive warhammer is even heavier than its size would normally warrant. A creature wielding the hammer takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a +4 bonus on damage rolls, as well as a -10 penalty to speed. Once picked up, this weapon must be used as the creature's primary weapon until subject to a successful <i>remove curse</i> spell.</p>	+2 warhammer	moderate transmutation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Helm of opposite alignment		12	3	<p><b>Slot: </b>head</p><p>When placed upon the head, this item's curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment-good to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required.</p><p>Only a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> can restore a character's former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible. If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an <i>atonement</i> spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a <i>helm of opposite alignment</i> has functioned once, it loses its magical properties. </p>	hat of disguise, helm of comprehend languages and read magic, helm of telepathy	strong transmutation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Incense of obsession		6	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>These blocks of incense appear to be <i>incense of meditation . </i>If meditation is conducted while the <i>incense of obsession </i>are burning, the user becomes totally confident that her spell ability is superior due to the magic incense. She uses her spells at every opportunity, even when not needed or useless. The user remains obsessed with her abilities and spells until all have been used or cast, or until 24 hours have elapsed. </p>	incense of meditation	moderate enchantment
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Mace of blood		8	8	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This <i>+3 heavy mace </i>must be coated in blood every day, or else its bonus fades away until the mace is coated again.

Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Mask of ugliness		8	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>head</p><p>This strange, featureless mask seems to have the powers of a <i>headband of alluring charisma +4</i>, but instead of granting a bonus to Charisma, the mask melds to the wearer's face, making him seem uglier and his words come off as crude and insulting. The wearer takes a -4 penalty to Bluff and Diplomacy checks but gains a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks. </p>	any magical mask or a headband of alluring charisma	moderate transmutation
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Medallion of thought projection		7	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>neck</p><p>This device seems like a <i>medallion of thoughts</i>, even down to the range at which it functions, except that the thoughts overheard are muffled and distorted, requiring a DC 15 Will save to sort them out. However, while the user thinks she is picking up the thoughts of others, all she is really hearing are figments created by the medallion itself. These illusory thoughts always seem plausible, and thus can seriously mislead any who rely upon them. What's worse, unknown to her, the cursed medallion actually broadcasts her thoughts to creatures in the path of the beam, thus alerting them to her presence.</p>	medallion of thoughts	moderate divination
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Nearfiring bow		6	2	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This bow appears to be a <i>+2 distance shortbow</i>, but its curse is that it suffers a -4 cumulative penalty for each range increment beyond the first. Furthermore, it takes an additional -4 penalty on critical confirmation rolls when firing beyond the first range increment. This bow must be used as its wielder's primary ranged weapon and can only be discarded after the owner is subject to a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar effect. </p>	+2 distance shortbow	moderate divination
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Necklace of strangulation		18	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>neck</p><p>A <i>necklace of strangulation </i>appears to be a wondrous piece of magical jewelry. When placed on the neck, the necklace immediately tightens, dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of a <i>limited wish ,  wish , </i>or <i>miracle , </i>and remains clasped around the victim's throat even after his death. Only when he has decayed to a dry skeleton (after approximately 1 month) does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim. </p>	necklace of adaptation, necklace of fireballs, periapt of health, periapt of proof against poison, periapt of wound closure	strong conjuration

Cursed Item		Cursed Item		One-way window		5	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This small, 6-inch-square glass tablet grows to a 6-foot-by-3-foot window if placed on any sufficiently large vertical surface and returns to its original size if removed. The window melds ever so slightly into the surface, allowing it to ignore minor protrusions, curves, or anything else that would normally make it difficult to simply lay down a pane of glass.</p><p>On command, the front of this glass displays all activities on the other side of this surface like a window, piercing wood, earth, or stone up to 10 feet deep, but not metal. The window does not reveal its existence to non-hostile creatures depicted within it, allowing observers to study them at their leisure.</p><p>However, once the owner of the window uses it to spy on hostile creatures, its curse activates. From that moment on, the window presents its owner and anyone looking through the window with an artificial image of the other side designed to lull them into a sense of false confidence-enemies appear sleeping or drunk, pits have obvious plank bridges for easy crossing, and so on. While presenting this image to those in front of the mirror, it reveals those viewers to the enemies being observed, creating a two-way window; however, viewed creatures see those using the mirror accurately and can read their thoughts as if using <i>detect thoughts</i>. Furthermore, the image shown to those using the mirror does not reveal that the creatures they are watching can see them as well.</p><p>Once the curse activates, the owner comes to regard using the mirror to spy ahead as his most effective tactic (after all, it has no limit to its duration) and does so whenever possible until curse-breaking magic frees him from its influence. Anyone who uses the mirror to spy on hostiles, even if he wasn't the one to activate the mirror, is also subject to this desire to continue using it.</p>	mirror of life trapping, mirror of opposition	faint divination
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Ornery pistol 		12	4	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This pistol acts as a normal <i>+2 pistol</i>, but it has a strange aversion to talk of peace. Anytime the wielder or an ally within line of sight that the wielder can hear attempts to improve a creature's initial attitude with the Diplomacy skill, without spending an action, the pistol leaps into the wielder's hand and takes a single shot at the creature the wielder or ally is using Diplomacy against. If the wielder or ally is attempting to affect multiple creatures, the gun shoots a random member of the group. This occurs even if the pistol is unloaded, as the pistol's curse magically loads itself with a normal bullet and black powder when the action is taken. </p>	any pistol	strong transmutation

Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Periapt of foul rotting		10	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>neck</p><p>This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only by application of a <i>remove curse</i> spell followed by a <i>cure disease </i>and then a <i>heal ,  miracle ,  limited wish</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a <i>periapt of health</i> and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon the <i>periapt of foul rotting</i> likewise crumbles to dust.</p>	periapt of health, periapt of proof against poison, periapt of wound closure	moderate abjuration

If the initial saving throw succeeds, the creature wearing the cloak must make further checks at the start of each of its turns. On any failed saving throw the creature becomes petrified.

Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Planar invasion shield		17	15	<p><b>Slot: </b>shield</p><p>This shield behaves in all ways as an <i>absorbing shield</i> until its owner attempts to use its disintegration power in combat. Once he does, it instead causes one or more monsters to pour forth from the shield and attack the nearest creature each round (including the shield-bearer) for 1d6 rounds before retreating by the safest possible route. If there is no such path for them to escape, the monsters fight to the death. To determine the nature and number of the monsters, roll 2d4 to determine the level of the <i>summon monster</i> spell and roll 1d3 to determine the number of creatures that appear. Monsters conjured by this shield remain until killed, act as normal for their kind, and are treated as summoned creatures with a permanent duration.</p><p>Once its curse activates, the shield calls forth monsters three times per day, approximately every 8 hours. If the monsters cannot emerge directly from the shield and survive (for example, because it's buried or underwater), they instead appear at the nearest safe location within 50 feet. Successful curse-breaking magic cast on the shield restores it to its previous guise as an <i>absorbing shield</i> and allows its wearer to abandon it.</p>	absorbing shield	strong conjuration
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Poisonous cloak		15	1	<p><b>Slot: </b>shoulders</p><p>This cloak is usually made of wool, although it can be made of leather. A <i>detect poison </i>spell can reveal the presence of poison in the cloak's fabric. The garment can be handled without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned, the wearer takes 4d6 points of Constitution damage unless she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.</p><p>Once donned, a <i>poisonous cloak</i> can be removed only with a <i>remove curse</i> spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak.

Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Ring of lifebleed		10	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>ring</p><p>Before being worn, this ring appears to be a <i>ring of regeneration</i>. Once it is worn in combat, however, the true nature of the ring becomes apparent. Each time the wearer is hit with a melee or ranged weapon attack, he takes an additional 1d4 points of damage. This ring cannot be removed until the wearer dies or by way of a <i>remove curse</i>, <i>wish,</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell. </p>	ring of regeneration	moderate necromancy
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Ring of spell devouring		13	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>ring</p><p>This delicate ring appears to be a <i>ring of spell storing</i> or a <i>ring of spell turning</i>, but instead of aiding casting or counterspelling, the ring hinders such efforts. Each time the wearer casts an arcane spell, he suffers a 25% spell failure chance. Furthermore, the wearer of the ring takes a -4 penalty on Spellcraft checks to identify a spell when attempting to counterspell. The ring can only be removed by a <i>remove curse</i> spell or a similar effect. </p>	ring of spell storing (any) or a ring of spell turning	strong abjuration

The wearer of this cursed ring is rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in either speech or writing. The wearer may simply omit the truth or choose not to communicate, but even then must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw to avoid answering a direct question truthfully.

Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Riot pipes		10	3	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>This simple musical instrument seems and behaves in all ways like any other kind of magical pipes until its owner plays it in an urban setting. Once he does, it requires all people within hearing range to make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid falling into a murderous fury. Those who fail their saves gain the effects of a <i>rage</i> spell for the next 1d6 hours and experience a strong compulsion (DC 15 Will save negates) to attack any stranger or disliked person whom they encounter during this time. If the owner spends more than 3 consecutive days in an urban setting, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw each day to avoid playing the <i>riot pipes</i> at some point during each subsequent day. The pipes remain with the player until the curse is broken.</p>	pipes of haunting, pipes of the sewers, pipes of sounding	moderate enchantment

As soon as a character dons this garment, she takes a -10 penalty to Strength, as well as to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, forgetting spells and magic knowledge accordingly.

However, as soon as he is in a situation requiring concentration and action against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment is revealed: the wearer immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the insects that magically infest the garment. He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally show signs of the extreme discomfort caused by the bites and movement of these pests.</p><p>The wearer takes a -5 penalty on initiative checks and a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks.

Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Rod of arson		12	5	<p><b>Slot: </b>none</p><p>All tests indicate that this hollow metal tube is a <i>rod of flame extinguishing</i> until its owner uses it to extinguish or suppress a fire in a combat or other dangerous situation. Once she does, she discovers that rather than quenching the flame, the rod causes the flame to enter her body. This flame persists inside of her for the next 24 hours, causing minor discomfort and giving her the sickened condition, but causing no visible injury. However, when the wielder is adjacent to or within a flammable object or structure, she feels inclined to set the object ablaze, using any means at her disposal. Each round the wielder resists this urge, she takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the flame within her surges and roils. After 1 minute of this, she must make a DC 15 Will save or succumb to the temptation; if she saves, the urge passes, the internal fire stops harming her, and she can interact normally with the flammable target thereafter.</p><p>Once the curse reveals itself, the owner must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid using the item to try and extinguish or suppress any fire she encounters which she herself did not start. She cannot use the rod against fires that she personally started. Successful curse-breaking magic allows the wielder to get rid of the rod and harmlessly dissipates any fire persisting inside her from the action of the rod.</p>	rod of flame extinguishing	strong evocation

Once a creature picks up such a rod, it cannot be discarded without use of a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar magic. Each time the wielder casts a spell, he takes the <i>rod of foiled magic</i> in hand and treats the caster level of the spell as 2 levels lower. If this would reduce the caster level to 0 or lower, than the caster has only a 50% chance of casting the spell (any chance of arcane spell failure is added to this percentile chance), but if he is able to cast the spell, the spell has a caster level of 1st. </p>	Any metamagic rod	strong (no school)
Cursed Item		Cursed Item		Scarab of death		19	0	<p><b>Slot: </b>Neck</p><p>If this small scarab brooch is held for more than 1 round or carried in a living creature's possessions for 1 minute, it changes into a horrible, burrowing, beetlelike creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into flesh, and reaches the victim's heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but she still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal prevents it from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the item.</p>	amulet of mighty fists, amulet of natural armor, amulet of the planes, amulet of proof against detection and location, brooch of shielding, golembane scarab, scarab of protection	strong abjuration
