Gear	Alchemical Remedies	Gear	Alchemical Remedies	Fire ward gel	150 gp		1	<p><b>Craft DC: </b>25</p><p>When you apply this thin gel to your skin, armor, or clothing, it creates a resistant barrier that protects you from fire or heat damage. You gain fire resistance 5. The gel burns away as it absorbs fire damage; when it absorbs a total of 20 points of fire damage, it is discharged. Fire ward gel counts as <i>protection from energy</i> for the purpose of stacking multiple fire protection effects. Applying fire ward gel takes 1 minute, and it lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. Multiple applications of fire ward gel do not stack; applying more while a dose is active merely resets the potential amount of fire damage absorbed to 20 points.</p>

Gear	Alchemical Remedies	Gear	Alchemical Remedies	Padzahr	80 gp			<p><b>Craft DC: </b>25</p><p>Drinking this crystal-clear liquid accelerates the natural process of healing Constitution damage. Resting for 1 hour after drinking a vial heals you of 1 point of Constitution damage as if you had benefited from a full night's rest. Taking multiple doses in an hour does not increase the rate of healing; you must take each individually, followed by an hour of rest, for it to have any effect. Using more than 4 doses of padzahr in 1 day has no effect.</p>

A container of smelling salts has dozens of uses if stoppered after each use, but depletes in a matter of hours if left open.</p>

Normal-sized (Fine) vermin avoid you. Swarms of vermin must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude saving throw in order to enter your square. Vermin repellent has no adverse effect on vermin of Small size or larger, though if an attacking vermin has a choice of targets that are respectively covered and not covered in repellent, it usually chooses the creatures without repellent. Once applied, vermin repellent remains effective for 4 hours or until you spend 1 round washing it off.</p><p>Vermin repellent counts as a strong scent, allowing creatures with the scent ability to detect it at a greater range (see the Universal Monster Rules in the <i>Bestiary</i>).</p>		
Gear	Alchemical Remedies	Gear	Alchemical Remedies	Wismuth salix	30 gp			<p><b>Craft DC: </b>20</p><p>This pink liquid has a horrible chalky taste, but is quite effective at counteracting nausea, indigestion, and diarrhea.
