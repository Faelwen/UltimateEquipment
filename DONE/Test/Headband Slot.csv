Wondrous Item	Headband	Wondrous Item	Headband	Soulbound eye	30000 gp	16	0	"<p>Appearing at first like an expensive, masochistic adornment, this almond-sized star ruby is set in a gold clasp, one side of which is festooned with several long spikes. A <i>soulbound eye</i> is not an item that most creatures would voluntarily wear-they are instead crafted by powerful creatures who wish to use another creature as a sort of remote-viewing slave. A <i>soulbound eye</i> must be attached to a willing or helpless creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature's brow-the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim's forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared link between the wearer and the creature who placed the item on its head (the ""master"").</p><p>Once implanted, the <i>soulbound eye</i> allows the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer's senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between the wearer and the master. Neither of these features function across planar boundaries.</p><p>The <i>soulbound eye's</i> wearer is not compelled to obey its master's telepathic commands, but the master can use the <i>soulbound eye</i> as a conduit for <i>hold monster</i>, <i>modify memory</i>, <i>pain strike</i> , and <i>suggestion</i> spells, treating the wearer as the target of the spell no matter the distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells cast through the <i>soulbound eye.</i></p><p>An implanted <i>soulbound eye</i> functions like a cursed item once it is in place-it can only be removed if the curse is first lifted via an effect like <i>remove curse</i> or <i>break enchantment</i>. Once removed, a <i>soulbound eye</i> crumbles to fragments.</p>"	15,000 gp, craft wondrous item, scrying	strong necromancy
Wondrous Item	Headband	Wondrous Item	Headband	Veiled eye	12000 gp	5	0	<p>This banded agate attaches itself to its wearer's forehead and then, blinking and focusing, begins to act as an additional eye. When worn, the <i>veiled eye</i> has the same vision as the wearer (such as low-light vision, darkvision 60 ft., or the oracle's clouded vision curse). It grants the wearer no particular advantages so long as his original eyes continue to function normally. However, should his original eyes stop working, whether because of the wearer becoming blinded or even his own decision to close them, he can see through the <i>veiled eye </i>instead. When the wearer is using the veiled eye as his only vision source, he takes a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls but gains a +2 insight bonus on saves against gaze attacks.</p>	6,000 gp, craft wondrous item, remove blindness/deafness	faint conjuration
Wondrous Item	Headband	Wondrous Item	Headband	Winter wolf headband	32000 gp	7	1	<p>Crafted of pale bone or silver, this headband features a snarling wolf's head centered on the wearer's forehead. The wearer gains cold resistance 10. Once per day, the wearer may transform into a Large white-furred wolf for 11 minutes. In addition, once per day the wearer may breathe a 30-foot cone of cold that deals 7d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 16 for half). The wearer may use this breath weapon even when transformed.</p>	16,000 gp, craft wondrous item, beast shape ii, dragon's breath , resist energy	moderate transmutation
