Wondrous Item	Body	Eidolon anchoring harness	6,000 gp	Eidolon anchoring harness	6000 gp	7	1	<p>Loadstone studs line the straps of this ornate leather harness. When worn by an eidolon, the bindings act as a dimensional safety harness, anchoring the outsider to its current plane. Any time the eidolon would be forced to return to its home plane (such as when it's reduced to negative hit points equal to its Constitution score or when its master is rendered unconscious), it can expend one use of its summoner's <i>summon monster</i> spell-like ability as a free action to remain on the Material Plane for 1 round. The summoner does not need to be conscious for the eidolon to use this ability, but he must be within 100 feet. If the summoner is conscious, he can refuse to allow this expenditure (which means the eidolon is forced back to its home plane).</p><p>If the condition that would have sent the eidolon back to its home plane is still in effect after 1 round has passed, the eidolon may expend another use of its master's <i>summon monster</i> spell-like ability; otherwise it immediately returns to its home plane.</p>	3,000 gp, craft wondrous item, dimensional anchor	moderate abjuration

The spell must be on her spell list, the same spell level or lower than the expended spell slot, and the same type of spell (arcane or divine) as the spell slot expended. The caster must also understand the written source (such as using Decipher Script or <i>read magic</i>) and be carrying it. Activating the robe is not an action, but casting the spell otherwise works as normal, including casting time, providing components or foci, and so on. Using a <i>mnemonic vestment</i>'s properties does not consume the written source.</p>	2,500 gp, craft wondrous item, mnemonic enhancer, creator must be able to spontaneously cast spells	strong transmutation

This AC bonus functions just like the monk's AC bonus.</p>	6,500 gp, craft wondrous item, righteous might or transformation	moderate transmutation

The kimono grants its wearer a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws and a +4 bonus on all caster level checks.</p><p>Once per day, the wearer can capture a single creature within 60 feet within the kimono (no save), shunting the victim into an extradimensional space similar to that created by a <i>maze</i> spell. Inside this otherworldly prison, the maze appears as an endless cherry orchard filled with ""walls"" of windblown cherry blossoms and cranes flying overhead. Each round on its turn, the victim inside the kimono may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the kimono as a full-round action. If the victim doesn't escape, it is released after 10 minutes, returning to where it had been before the kimono drew it in. If this location is occupied by another creature or a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space.</p><p>Whenever a creature is drawn inside the kimono, the victim's image temporarily manifests as another embroidered design among the kimono's other images.

When a sorcerer dons a robe of arcane heritage, the stitching pulls itself apart and reweaves to match her particular sorcerer bloodline.

Wondrous Item	Body	Robe of bones	2,400 gp	Robe of bones	2400 gp	6	1	<p>This sinister item functions much like a <i>robe of useful items</i>, but specifically for the serious necromancer. It appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the wearer of the robe can see the embroidery, recognize them as the creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned, or destroyed. A newly created <i>robe of bones</i> always has two embroidered figures of each of the following undead:</p><ul><li>Human skeleton</li><li>Fast goblin zombie</li><li>Wolf skeleton</li><li>Tough human zombie</li><li>Heavy horse skeleton</li><li>Plague ogre zombie</li></ul>	1,200 gp, craft wondrous item, animate dead	moderate necromancy
Wondrous Item	Body	Robe of components	5,000 gp	Robe of components	5000 gp	7	1	<p>The pockets of this simple blue robe always seem to carry just what the wearer needs whenever she casts a spell. The robe functions as a spell component pouch, providing any spell components or focuses that are necessary for the wearer's spellcasting. The robe can even produce spell components or focuses with a specific cost, though it provides no more than 50 gp worth of such materials in any single day. The materials supplied by the robe are suitable only for spellcasting, and disappear if they leave the wearer's person or when the spell requiring them is cast.</p>	2,500 gp, craft wondrous item, minor creation	moderate conjuration

The wearer of a <i>robe of eyes</i> gains a +10 competence bonus on Perception checks. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and can't be flanked.

Wondrous Item	Body	Robe of gates	64,000 gp	Robe of gates	64000 gp	17	1	<p>Silver circles and conjuring runes decorate this black robe. Three times per day when the wearer uses a summoning spell or spell-like ability to summon a variable number of creatures, he can choose to summon the maximum number of creatures possible. Creatures summoned in this way step from the shadowy folds of the robe, and appear adjacent to the wearer. If there isn't sufficient room for all the creatures to appear, the extra creatures are wasted and do not appear.</p><p>If the wearer is a summoner, he can call upon the robe to summon his eidolon as a standard action once per day.

Wondrous Item	Body	Robe of infinite twine	1,000 gp	Robe of infinite twine	1000 gp	7	1	<p>This coarse hempen robe seems made from a single strand of twine. The wearer can draw up to 30 feet of twine or up to 10 feet of hemp rope per round from the robe without harming it.  As an immediate action, the wearer can draw up to 150 feet of twine or 50 feet of rope from the robe, but this gives the robe the broken condition and suppresses its powers until it is repaired. Twine or rope drawn from the robe remains connected until cut or torn, but is treated as common material rather than part of a magic item. Pieces removed become normal twine or rope.</p>	500 gp, craft wondrous item, minor creation	moderate conjuration
Wondrous Item	Body	Robe of needles 	1,000 gp	Robe of needles	1000 gp	5	4	<p>This dark, hooded robe has six long, silvery, razor-sharp needles protruding from the bottom of its loose sleeves, three on each side. The wearer can launch one needle as a ranged touch attack. The needle counts as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the needle hits, it embeds itself in the target's flesh, dealing 1 point of piercing damage and 1 point of bleed damage. A creature can pull out the needle as a full-round action, which ends the bleed effect. The needle is destroyed if an attack with it misses or when it is removed from a creature it was embedded in. The robe regrows all spent needles each morning.</p>	500 gp, craft wondrous item, bleed	faint evocation

The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect.</p><p>Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the wearer starts at 10% and increases by 10% each round until it reaches 50% (total concealment). Additionally the robe continuously illuminates a 30-foot radius. The effect can be used no more than a total of 10 rounds per day.</p>	13,500 gp, craft wondrous item, blur, rainbow pattern	moderate illusion

It can be white (01-45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46-75, neither good nor evil alignment), or black (76-100, evil alignment). To most wearers, the robe offers no powers or has no effects unless the wearer's alignment doesn't match that of the robe (see below). Only an arcane spellcaster can fully realize this potent magic item's powers once the robe is donned. These powers are as follows.</p><ul><li>+5 armor bonus to AC</li><li>Spell resistance 18</li><li>+4 resistance bonus on all saving throws</li><li>+2 enhancement bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance</li></ul><p>If a white robe is donned by an evil character, she immediately gains three permanent negative levels.

An evil or good character who puts on a gray robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black robe, gains two permanent negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be overcome in any way (including through <i>restoration</i> spells). Negative levels are immediately removed if the robe is removed from the wearer.</p>	37,500 gp, craft wondrous item, antimagic field, mage armor or shield of faith, creator must be of same alignment as robe	strong varied

Only the wearer of the robe can see the true shapes of these patches, recognize them for what items they become, and detach them. One patch can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as indicated below. A newly created robe of useful items always has two each of the following patches:</p><ul><li>Dagger</li><li>Bullseye lantern (full and lit)</li><li>Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror)</li><li>Pole (10-foot length)</li><li>Hempen rope (50-foot coil)</li><li>Sack</li></ul><p>In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for the number of other patches and then roll for each patch on the table below to determine its nature.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d%</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>01-08</td><td>Bag of 100 gold pieces</td></tr><tr><td>09-15</td><td>Coffer, silver (6 in. by 6 in. by 1 ft.), 500 gp value</td></tr><tr><td>16-22</td><td>Door, iron (up to 10 ft. wide and 10 ft. high and barred on one side-must be placed upright, attaches and hinges itself)</td></tr><tr><td>23-30</td><td>Gems, 10 (100 gp value each)</td></tr><tr><td>31-44</td><td>Ladder, wooden (24 ft. long)</td></tr><tr><td>45-51</td><td>Mule (with saddlebags)</td></tr><tr><td>52-59</td><td>Pit, open (10 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.)</td></tr><tr><td>60-68</td><td><i>Potion of cure serious wounds</i></td></tr><tr><td>69-75</td><td>Rowboat (12 ft. long)</td></tr><tr><td>76-83</td><td>Minor scroll of one randomly determined spell</td></tr><tr><td>84-90</td><td>War dogs, pair (treat as riding dogs)</td></tr><tr><td>91-96</td><td>Window (2 ft. by 4 ft., up to 2 ft. deep)</td></tr><tr><td>97-100</td><td>Portable ram</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Multiple items of the same kind are permissible.

Wondrous Item	Body	Shocking robe	11,000 gp	Shocking robe	11000 gp	10	1	<p>This violet and yellow silk robe gives the impression of electricity crackling over its surface. The robe grants the wearer electricity resistance 5 and increases the wearer's caster level for all spells with the electricity descriptor by +1. Once per day on command, the wearer of the robe can emit a 20-foot-radius burst of electricity. Creatures other than the wearer within the area take 2d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 16 half).</p>	5,500 gp, craft wondrous item, heighten spell, resist energy, lightning bolt	moderate abjuration and evocation
Wondrous Item	Body	Smuggler's collapsible robe	48,000 gp	Smuggler's collapsible robe	48000 gp	9	1	<p>Appearing to be nothing more than a ratty wool robe with a hood, this garment is an invaluable tool for spies, thieves, and smugglers. On command, the wearer and non-living objects up to her maximum load are sucked into an extradimensional space within the robe, leaving the robe to collapse where the wearer was standing. The robe appears to be merely a pile of discarded clothes, and does not detect as magical or function so long as the wearer is within the extradimensional space.</p><p>While inside the extradimensional space, the wearer cannot take most actions, but can breathe comfortably for up to 24 hours. The wearer can see the area around the robe, though special senses such as darkvision or blindsense do not function. The wearer may leave the extradimensional space with a thought as a free action-the only action he can make while inside the extradimensional space. He reappears wearing the robe once more. However, if there is not enough room for the wearer to reappear (for example, if the robe was placed inside a small box) then the wearer cannot leave the extradimensional space.</p><p>If the robe is destroyed or its magic suppressed while the wearer is within the extradimensional space, or if he spends 24 hours within it, he and all objects inside reappear instantaneously in the robe's space, and the wearer is dazed for one round.</p>	24,000 gp, craft wondrous item, secret chest, magic aura, arcane eye	moderate conjuration
Wondrous Item	Body	Sorcerer's robe	5,000 gp	Sorcerer's robe	5000 gp	10	1	<p>This dapper robe enables a sorcerer to add the effects of her 1st-level bloodline power to spells she casts. As a swift action before casting a spell, the wearer expends one use of her 1st-level bloodline power and selects one target of the spell to be affected by that bloodline power. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save against the spell means the bloodline power deals half damage (if it normally deals hit point damage) or is negated (if it does not). The robe can be used up to three times per day.</p>	2,500 gp, craft wondrous item, quicken spell-like ability, creator must be a sorcerer	moderate evocation
Wondrous Item	Body	Voidfrost robes	11,000 gp	Voidfrost robe	11000 gp	10	1	<p>This blue and white silk robe gives the impression of ice and frozen fog forming over its surface. The robe grants the wearer cold resistance 5 and increases the wearer's caster level for all spells with the cold descriptor by +1. Once per day on command, the wearer of the robe can emit a 20-foot-radius burst of cold. Creatures other than the wearer within the area take 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 16 half).</p>	5,500 gp, craft wondrous item, heighten spell, resist energy, cone of cold	moderate abjuration and evocation
Wondrous Item	Body	Xorn robe	20,000 gp	Xorn robe	20000 gp	9	1	<p>This brown and gray robe is always dirty, and the chest and the back of each shoulder is decorated with a gem-like eye pattern. The wearer gains a +5 bonus on Perception checks, and can use earth glide to pass through up to 20 feet of natural or worked stone per day. The distance traveled with earth glide does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 5-foot increments. The wearer is able to safely chew, swallow, digest, and derive nutrition from gems, precious metals, and metallic ore, with 100 gp worth of these materials sustaining him for 1 full day. If the wearer removes the robe after such a meal, he is sickened until 24 hours have passed since the last meal of this kind. Wearing the robe again immediately negates this penalty.</p>	10,000 gp, craft wondrous item, passwall, purify food and drink	moderate transmutation
