Ring		Decoy ring	12000 gp	11	0	<p>This ring is a thick loop of mirrorlike metal. Whenever the wearer of this ring takes the withdraw action or becomes helpless (including falling unconscious), it instantly makes her invisible for 3 rounds and creates four illusory duplicates that either run off in opposite directions or perform other plausible actions that could draw enemy attention away from her. The duplicates last for 3 rounds before disappearing, but they instantly pop out of existence if struck by an attack (AC 10) and can be disbelieved (Will DC 19). Allies of the wearer always know her true location and can freely provide aid or assistance to her.</p>	6,000 gp, forge ring, mislead	moderate illusion

Ring		Ring of arcane mastery	20000 gp	11	0	<p>This ring is a thin but sturdy piece of forged steel crafted to resemble a serpent swallowing its tail, and is magically imbued to reveal the secrets of arcane mastery to its wearer. The ring allows a wearer with an arcane pool to store up to 4 points from his arcane pool in the ring as a swift action. These points remain in the ring until used.

Ring		Ring of arcane signets	1000 gp	8	0	<p>The approximately 1-inch-diameter pentagon of emerald green crystal that dominates this otherwise plain silver ring forms itself into a specific rune, sigil, or similar identifying marker each time a person first puts it on. If the wearer expects this to occur, she can cause the crystal to adopt any shape she wishes. If the wearer does not expect this to occur, the crystal instead molds itself into an image that symbolizes the wearer or some dominant facet of her personality. Once the crystal assumes this initial form, it always takes that form whenever the same wearer puts on the ring. The wearer can, as a standard action, embed this image on any object (as if using <i>arcane mark</i>) simply by pressing the ring against it. The wearer may choose the color and other cosmetic features of the image each time she uses the ring. The brand is otherwise permanent unless removed by <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>erase</i>, or a more powerful spell. </p>	500 gp, forge ring, arcane mark	faint universal

Ring		Ring of continuation	56000 gp	7	0	<p>This band of braided copper wires throbs ever so slightly in harmony with its wearer's heartbeat. Whenever the wearer of this ring casts a spell with a range of personal, that spell remains in effect for 24 hours or until the wearer casts another spell with a range of personal (whichever comes first). Spells that usually only affect one specific action (such as making a particular attack) are expended after that action. This does not reduce the duration of spells that normally last longer than 24 hours. Casting a new spell does not eliminate a previous spell if its normal duration is such that it would still be in effect. However, attempts to dispel or otherwise eliminate a spell kept active by the ring work normally and, if successful, remove the spell from the ring, causing the wearer to lose all benefits from that spell. </p>	28,000 gp, forge ring, mnemonic enhancer	moderate transmutation
Ring		Ring of counterspells	4000 gp	11	0	<p>Upon first examination, this ring seems to be a <i>ring of spell storing</i>. However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) may be placed into it again. </p>	2,000 gp, forge ring, imbue with spell ability	moderate evocation
Ring		Ring of craft magic	12000 gp	3	0	<p>A <i>ring of craft magic</i> always bears some sort of tool-like design in its craftsmanship. The wearer of the ring sees spells as similar to crafts, and vice versa. The wearer may make a Craft check in place of a Spellcraft check to identify an item that could be created with that Craft skill. The wearer may also expend a spell slot or prepared spell to gain an enhancement bonus equal to the level of the expended spell on a single Craft or Profession check (regardless of the amount of time needed to make the check).</p>	6,000 gp, forge ring, creator must have the obsession racial trait	faint transmutation
Ring		Ring of curing	10000 gp	8	0	<p>This simple copper ring is a boon to those who spend their lives healing others. Whenever the wearer of a <i>ring of curing </i>casts a conjuration spell of the healing subschool, all maximums to the level-dependent healing provided by that spell increase by 2. For example, <i>cure light wounds</i> would provide a maximum healing of 1d8 + 7 (at 7th caster level), while <i>heal</i> would cure a maximum of 170 points of damage. This ring does not increase the wearer's actual caster level, nor the amount of level-dependent healing provided by any such spell.</p>	5,000 gp, forge ring, heighten spell, consecrate	moderate transmutation
Ring		Ring of delayed doom	45000 gp	9	0	<p>Whenever the mind or body of this ring's wearer first becomes subject to any harmful effect that allows a saving throw to resist or mitigate it, he may, as an immediate action, choose to delay the onset of that effect for 1 minute, after he fails the saving throw but before its effects occur. This activation causes one of the ring's nine garnets to turn to powder. When that minute passes, the wearer may continue to delay the onset of this harmful effect an additional minute as an immediate action by willing the ring to do so, which destroys another garnet, thus repeating the cycle for another minute. The delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls unconscious, when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time the ring's power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect do not count toward the effect's duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the wearer delayed its effect several minutes). Effects that protect against or negate the harmful effect work normally while it is delayed. The price of the ring is reduced by 5,000 gp for each of its garnets that ha sbeen destroyed.</p>	22,500 gp, forge ring, heal, time stop	moderate conjuration

Ring		Ring of ectoplasmic invigoration	12000 gp	6	0	<p>A summoner wearing a <i>ring of ectoplasmic invigoration</i> can use his maker's call class feature to absorb his eidolon (dismissing it in the process) instead of bringing it to his side. He gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die of the eidolon and the benefits of a <i>lesser restoration</i> spell. The eidolon must still be within range of his maker's call ability. Any temporary hit points gained fade after 1 hour or when the eidolon is summoned again. A wearer with the transposition ability can transport himself to the eidolon's square (still absorbing and dismissing it) rather than calling the eidolon to him.</p>	6,000 gp, forge ring, the creator must be able to summon an eidolon and have the maker's call class feature	moderate conjuration
Ring		Ring of elemental command	200000 gp	15	0	<p>All four kinds of <i>rings of elemental command</i> are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.</p><p>Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.</p><p>Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.</p><p>The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if she is strong. If she is weak, they hate and desire to slay her.</p><p>The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Element</th><th>Saving Throw Penalty</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Air</td><td>-2 against earth-based effects</td></tr><tr><td>Earth</td><td>-2 against air- or electricity-based effects</td></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td>-2 against water- or cold-based effects</td></tr><tr><td>Water</td><td>-2 against fire-based effects</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.</p><p><b>Ring of Elemental Command (Air)</b></p><ul><li><i>Wind wall</i> (unlimited use)</li><li><i>Feather fall</i> (unlimited use, wearer only)</li><li><i>Resist energy (electricity)</i> (unlimited use, wearer only)</li><li><i>Gust of wind</i> (twice per day)</li><li><i>Air walk</i> (once per day, wearer only)</li><li><i>Chain lightning</i> (once per week)</li></ul><p>This ring appears to be a <i>ring of feather falling</i> until a certain condition is met to activate its full potential.
