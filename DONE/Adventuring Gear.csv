Alchemist's kit	40 gp	24	<p>This kit includes an alchemy crafting kit, a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a flint and steel, ink, an inkpen, an iron pot, a mess kit, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin. The kit does not contain a formula book because an alchemist begins play with a formula book and does not need to purchase one.</p>
Animal glue	5 sp	0.5	<p>This simple glue is created by extensively boiling animal skin, bones, hooves, horn, and tendons until they turn into a ochre syrup that cools when it hardens. Before you use animal glue, you must heat it until it liquefies. You normally apply it with a brush and hold the pieces together for a minute, at which point it is cooled and hardened. The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 40 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 15 Strength check. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square foot) requires a DC 10 Strength check. Animal glue slowly dissolves in water, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per 10 minutes. It softens if heated, even with steam, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per minute.</p>
Area map	50 gp	2	<p>A geographically relevant map grants a user a +1 circumstance bonus on Survival checks made to navigate in the wilderness. It also can be used to grant the same bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks made to navigate underground.</p>
Astrolabe	1000 gp	6	<p>This device consists of a flat disc upon which two other discs are mounted. The mounted discs can rotate on a central axis, allowing them to spin and move as days pass.

Anyone can be shown how to use an astrolabe at night to determine the date and time (which takes 1 minute). When using an astrolabe, you can make a Survival check using your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier to avoid becoming lost. </p>

Barbarian's kit	9 gp	26	<p>This kit includes a backpack, a belt pouch, a blanket, a flint and steel, an iron pot, rope, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.</p>
Barbed vest	10 gp	4	<p>Thin leather flaps keep the hundreds of tiny, fishhook-like needles dotting the surface of this black vest from harming you while you wear it. However, any creature that injures you with a natural or unarmed attack must make a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1 point of damage. If a creature swallows you, it takes 1 point of damage each round until it either spits you up, you escape, or you die (at which point the vest has sustained enough damage that it no longer serves as a threat). The vest can only be worn over light armor or no armor.</p>

Basket	4 sp	1	<p>This large basket has a lid and holds about 2 cubic feet.</p>
Bedroll	1 sp	5	<p>This consists of two woolen sheets sewn together along the bottom and one side to create a bag for sleeping in. Some have cloth straps along the open side so the bedroll can be tied closed while you are sleeping. It can be rolled and tied into a tight coil for storage or transport. Most people use a blanket with the bedroll to stay warm or provide a ground cushion.</p>
Bell	1 gp	0	<p>This handbell can produce only one loud note.</p>
Bell net	2 gp	2	<p>Copper bells hang at each the corners of this 5-foot-by-5-foot wire net. A bell net is designed to blanket gear while you sleep, hunt, cook, or otherwise can't give it your full attention, rasing an alarm if your possessions are disturbed. Creatures attempting to access gear protected by a bell net must succeed at a DC 25 Sleight of Hand check to avoid chiming the bells. Hearing the chiming bells of a bell net requires a DC 0 Perception check. Because the many bells chime when you move, traveling with a bell net gives you a -2 penalty on Stealth checks.</p>
Belt pouch	1 gp	0.5	<p>A typical leather or cloth belt pouch has a leather cord to cinch it shut and another to tie it to your belt. It is large enough to hold 100-200 coins or two apples.</p>
Blanket	5 sp	3	<p>This warm, woven blanket has straps so it can be rolled up and tied. Blankets are often used in conjunction with bedrolls to provide additional warmth or a ground cushion.</p>
Block and tackle	5 gp	5	<p>Whether it is used to hoist treasure from a pit or move supplies, a simple block-and-tackle pulley, when it is properly secured, adds a +5 circumstance bonus on Strength checks to lift heavy objects. Securing the pulley requires 1 minute.</p>

It provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks when dealing with city officials and a +2 circumstance bonus on Linguistics checks when creating forgeries. A book of letters is only accurate for a particular region, such as a country or even a town, and only provides its bonus relating to that region.</p>
Bottle	2 gp	1	<p>This glass bottle holds about a pint and includes a cork.</p>
Breakaway chains	65 gp	2	<p>These masterwork chains are easy to break, even though they look like normal chains (Perception DC 25 to notice the difference). A DC 10 Strength check breaks them instantly. </p>
Bucket	5 sp	2	<p>A typical bucket has a rope handle and can hold 1-2 gallons of liquid.</p>
Bullseye lantern	12 gp	3	<p>A bullseye lantern provides normal light in a 60-foot cone and increases the light level by one step in the area beyond that, out to a 120-foot cone (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A bullseye lantern does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil. You can carry a lantern in one hand. </p>
Buoy, common	5 gp	16	<p>A buoy is used to mark a specific spot in a lake, river, or similar body of water, making it possible for you to return to that location at a later date. A common buoy includes a float (typically an air-filled bladder or sealed gourd), a 200-foot length of twine, and a 15-pound stone used as an anchor. The float is usually painted a vivid color, and may have a small flag to attract attention. Though anchor buoys prove quite resilient to normal weather and tides, they offer little challenge to intelligent creatures determined to sabotage them. A superior buoy has a spherical or ovoid hollow metal float (typically copper), a length of chain rather than twine, and a metal anchor rather than a weight. </p>
Buoy, superior	10 gp	30	<p>A buoy is used to mark a specific spot in a lake, river, or similar body of water, making it possible for you to return to that location at a later date. A common buoy includes a float (typically an air-filled bladder or sealed gourd), a 200-foot length of twine, and a 15-pound stone used as an anchor. The float is usually painted a vivid color, and may have a small flag to attract attention. Though anchor buoys prove quite resilient to normal weather and tides, they offer little challenge to intelligent creatures determined to sabotage them. A superior buoy has a spherical or ovoid hollow metal float (typically copper), a length of chain rather than twine, and a metal anchor rather than a weight. </p>
Butterfly net	5 gp	2	<p>One end of this 6-foot-long pole supports a wide metal hoop covered by a thin mesh net. You can use this to sift objects from material capable of passing through the net, such as sand or water. You can also use a butterfly net to capture Fine or Diminutive creatures as if it were a net (weapon), though you don't need to re-fold the butterfly net if you miss, and you use the handle of the butterfly net like you would the rope of a net weapon. </p>
Caltrops	1 gp	2	<p>A caltrop is a four-pronged metal spike crafted so that one prong always faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square. </p><p>Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on one. Make an attack roll for the caltrops (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a caltrop. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble. </p><p>Caltrops may not work against unusual opponents. </p>
Camouflage netting	20 gp	5	<p>This loose mesh of twine and varicolored cloth is used to disguise the presence of creatures or large objects. Camouflage netting must be manufactured to provide camouflage in a single type of terrain, such as snow, sand, forest, grass, swamp, urban, or water. When you hide under the netting in the appropriate terrain, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks as long as you remain immobile and prone. Covering up with camouflage netting is a full-round action requiring a DC 10 Survival check (failure means you do not cover yourself correctly with the netting and do not gain its bonus on Stealth checks). You have the entangled condition when using the netting, except your Dexterity penalty does not affect your initiative or Stealth checks. Taking off camouflage netting is a move action, or a swift action if combined with a move action to stand up from a prone position. </p><p>You may spend 1 minute covering an object with camouflage netting. Make a Survival check with a -10 penalty and use the total as the Stealth check result for the object. Creatures who fail a Perception check against this Stealth DC do not recognize what the object is and usually treat it as a natural part of the terrain. For example, you can conceal a wagon as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two nets. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five nets and takes 10 minutes of work, and the Survival check penalty is -20 instead of -10. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 camouflage nets and takes 1 hour of work, and the Survival check penalty is -30 instead of -10. </p><p>A creature with the scent ability ignores the effect of camouflage netting and makes checks against your actual Stealth roll when in scent range. Any creature within 10 feet of a Large or larger object hidden by camouflage netting automatically recognizes it as an object covered in camouflage.</p>
Campsite kit	12 gp	80	<p>This kit is actually four bundles of gear, designed so four individuals can share the load. It consists of four bedrolls, four blankets, a day's worth of firewood, a flint and steel, a tindertwig, four mess kits, a cooking kit, and 8 days of trail rations (with the expectation that adventurers will supplement the rations with a little hunting as they travel). Adventurers expecting inclement weather should also purchase one or more tents.</p>

Candlestick	1 cp	0.5	<p>This saucerlike object has a flat bottom, a handle, and a spike on top. You can affix a candle onto the spike (up to 3 inches in diameter) and hold the candlestick by the handle.

A typical candlestick is crafted from baked clay or a cheap metal such as copper, but elaborate and expensive ones exist.</p>

Cypher books	150 gp	2	<p>These books, always sold in identical pairs, contain numbered grids on each page which simply and easily catalog random lists of words. This allows a user to write messages which substitute letters and numbers that reference the page, row, and column of a particular word found within the cypher book. A creature without access to the appropriate cypher book takes a -10 penalty on Linguistic checks made to decipher each page of a coded message. Writing a message using the cipher takes 10 times as long as writing an uncoded message, and decoding it with the cipher book takes as much time as writing the original coded message.</p>
Dragonslayer's kit	485 gp	64	<p>Aimed more at hired blades than seasoned adventurers, this kit provides supplemental equipment for outfitting hirelings to hunt dragons.

Fake footprint shoes	5 gp	2	<p>These oversized shoes are worn over normal footwear. They create footprints or bootprints that look like those left by another creature. Each pair creates a specific type of footprint, such as tiger, orc, goblin, or ogre. When walking with these shoes, you may make a Survival check; the check result is the Survival DC for anyone trying to determine whether the tracks are what they appear to be.</p>
False manacles	65 gp	2	<p>These manacles are nearly indistinguishable from standard manacles upon inspection (Perception DC 25). A wearer who knows the location of the secret catch can open them as a standard action; otherwise they act like masterwork manacles.

Spotting the secret compartment in an empty cup requires a DC 15 Perception check.</p>
False-bottomed scabbard	45 gp	1	<p>The space at the bottom of this sword scabbard is just large enough to hold a potion flask. Some are accessed from the outside; others open on the inside with a secret catch at the top end.

While the sponges are moist, the hood grants you a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against inhaled poisons and other airborne attacks that require you to breathe them. Moistening the sponges with water is a standard action. The sponges dry out after 1d4 � 10 minutes and should be thoroughly rinsed after each use.</p>

Assembling or collapsing the pole is a full-round action. The hinges and pins mean it is not as strong as a one-piece pole, and is best used for probing rather than vaulting or climbing.</p>
Folding table	10 gp	20	<p>This wooden table has jointed legs and a hinge down the middle. When fully extended, it is a 2-foot-by-4-foot table, but collapses down to 2 feet by 2 feet by 2 inches. Setting up the table is a full-round action; collapsing it is 2 full-round actions.</p>

Most thieves use glue paper with a glass cutter to reduce noise and capture glass fragments.</p>
Glue paper	1 sp	0	<p>This 1-foot-square piece of paper is coated on one side with a weak glue or sticky material such as tree sap or even honey. It is stored folded in half.

Hammock	1 sp	3	<p>This blanket or net is attached to strong ropes, allowing you to hang it from a heavy branch or two trees and sleep above the ground. Climbing into or out of a hammock is a full-round action. A successful DC 5 Dexterity check reduces this to a move action.</p>
Harrow deck	100 gp	0	<p>This is a traditional fortune-telling deck of cards used by soothsayers and seers.

Hip flask	1 gp	0.5	<p>This metal canteen has a flattened, curved shape so you can easily conceal it in a pocket or against your body. A typical hip flask holds 8 ounces, and like a regular flask may be little more than a plain canteen or a decorative work of art.</p>
Hollowed pommel	5 gp	0	<p>Depending on the weapon, a hollow pommel may hold something as large as a flask or as small as a rolled piece of paper. Detecting a hollow pommel requires a DC 15 Perception check.</p>
Holy symbol, wooden	1 gp	0	<p>A holy symbol focuses positive energy and is used by good clerics and paladins (or by neutral clerics who want to cast good spells or channel positive energy). Each religion has its own holy symbol. The material used to make the holy symbol has no effect on its powers, though a religion may place special significance on a particular material. </p><p><i>Unholy Symbols</i>: An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is used by evil clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or channel negative energy).</p>

Holy symbol, compartment	5 gp	0	<p>Designed and approved by a member of the appropriate religion, this modification to a holy symbol creates a secret compartment large enough to hold a potion vial. Detecting the compartment requires a DC 20 Perception check.</p>
Holy symbol, flask	10 gp	0	<p>This version of a standard holy symbol is oversized and has a watertight compartment that can hold 1 pint (the same volume as a flask of holy water). Adventurers normally use the compartment to hold holy water or alcohol. A holy symbol flask is not meant for you to throw at enemies and is not fragile like a flask or vial. Like using holy water on incorporeal opponent, you unstopper the flask and pour the contents onto an adjacent target. Detecting the compartment requires a successful DC 10 Perception check.</p>
Holy symbol, tattoo	100 gp	0	<p>In some religions, you are allowed to tattoo or brand your deity's holy symbol onto your skin (typically the palm, back of the hand, or forearm) in a special ceremony. Thereafter, it functions like an actual holy symbol of your faith, and you may use it as a divine focus for spellcasting, channeling energy, and so on. The tattoo must be fully visible to use it in this way (it cannot be covered with a glove, gauntlet, or any other material). The listed price includes the cost of a simple brand or non-fading black tattoo; add appropriate tattoo costs if you want something more elaborate. Specifically damaging or erasing the tattoo or brand negates its use as an actual holy symbol.</p>

The cheap variety is a small, light book with no illustrations, printed or written on thin paper, and with a cover made of canvas or thin leather.

Lamp	1 sp	1	<p>A common lamp illuminates a small area, providing normal light in a 15-foot radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional 15 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A lamp does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lamp burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.</p>
Lock, simple	20 gp	1	<p>This can be a padlock, an inset lock in a door or chest, or any other type of keyed lock. The DC to open a lock with the Disable Device skill depends on the lock's quality: simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), or superior (DC 40).</p>
Lock, average	40 gp	1	<p>This can be a padlock, an inset lock in a door or chest, or any other type of keyed lock. The DC to open a lock with the Disable Device skill depends on the lock's quality: simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), or superior (DC 40).</p>

Magnet	5 sp	0.5	<p>Handheld magnets are relatively weak and are mainly used to detect or pull iron, mithral, or adamantine at a short range. They are not powerful enough to tug metal over significant distances or aid in disarming creatures wielding metal weapons. This hand-sized horseshoe magnet can lift up to a 3-pound iron weight.</p>
Magnifying glass	100 gp	0	<p>This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for a flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires bright light, such as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a full-round action. A magnifying glass grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed.</p>
Magus's kit	22 gp	31	<p>This includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a flint and steel, ink, an inkpen, an iron pot, a mess kit, rope, soap, a spell component pouch, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin. The kit does not contain a spellbook because a magus begins play with a spellbook.</p>
Manacles, common	15 gp	2	<p>Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points. </p><p>Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the price of the manacles. </p><p>For the same price, you can buy manacles for a Small creature. For a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times the indicated amount.</p><p><i>Mithral Manacles</i>: These bindings are more difficult to break than standard manacles and are particularly useful against lycanthropes. They have hardness 15, 30 hit points, and a break DC of 30. They are otherwise treated as masterwork manacles</p>

Marbles	1 sp	2	<p>Marbles can be used to slow opponents. One 2-pound bag of marbles covers an area 5 feet square.

Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a square of marbles with no trouble.</p>
Mess kit	2 sp	1	<p>This kit includes a plate, bowl, cup, fork, knife, and spoon, made of wood, horn, or tin. Each item has a handle or small hole, and can be tied together using the included leather cord.</p>
Miner's pick	3 gp	10	<p>If a miner's pick is used in combat, treat it as a two-handed improvised weapon that deals piercing damage equal to that of a heavy pick of its size.</p>
Mirror	10 gp	0.5	<p>This hand-held mirror is about a foot across. Unlike many higher-quality glass mirrors, this one is made out of polished steel and sturdy enough that you can drop it without risk of breakage.</p>
Mock armor	90 gp	10	<p>When an arcane caster needs a disguise, she might don a suit of mock armor. Made from leather or thin wood such as balsa or bamboo and painted to look like metal, a suit of mock armor passes as full plate under all but the closest scrutiny. A character inspecting someone in mock armor must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to identify it as fake. Mock armor gives you no Armor Class bonus, doesn't affect your maximum Dexterity bonus, and has no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. It cannot be given magical armor abilities, whether enhancement bonuses or properties like <i>fortification</i> or <i>ghost touch</i>. When wearing mock armor, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to conceal your identity or allegiance as a spellcaster (for example, in cities where arcane spellcasting is illegal). The Craft (carpentry) or Craft (leather) DC to create mock armor is 25.</p>
Monk's kit	8 gp	22	<p>This kit includes a backpack, a belt pouch, a blanket, rope, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.</p>

Oil	1 sp	1	<p>A 1-pint flask of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern or lamp. You can also use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist's fire, except that it takes a full-round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully. </p><p>You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.</p>
Oracle's kit	9 gp	29	<p>This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, candles (10), a flint and steel, an iron pot, mess kit, rope, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.</p>

Pathfinder's kit	12 gp	22	<p>This kit consists of a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a clay mug, a dagger, two fishhooks, a flint and steel, a sewing needle, a signal whistle, 50 feet of string, 50 feet of thread, a waterskin, a week's worth of trail rations, and a whetstone. For Small creatures, the weight of a Pathfinder's kit is 7-1/2 pounds. Leaving the bedroll and rations at camp or on a mount reduces the weight by 12 pounds for Medium creatures and by 3 pounds for Small creatures.</p>
Perfume/cologne	5 gp	0	<p>Most perfumes and colognes are derived from the essential oils of flowers. Perfume or cologne may (at the GM's discretion) provide a +1 circumstance bonus on several Charisma-based skill checks.</p>
Periscope	20 gp	4	<p>This 2-foot-long metal tube has right angles at each end with mirrors inside; if you look in one end, you can see out the other end, allowing you safely peer over obstacles, around corners, or into small spaces your head where wouldn't fit. When using a periscope, the end of the tube counts as a Diminutive object, making it much less likely that an observed creature notices you; if you have total concealment from the creature except for the end of the periscope, use the tube's Diminutive size modifier on your Stealth check instead of your own size modifier. Distortion from the mirrors gives you a -4 penalty on Perception checks while looking through the periscope. Though the tube is fairly sturdy (hardness 5, 2 hit points), the mirrors inside are fragile (hardness 1, 1 hit point), and any damage that gets through the tube's hardness applies to the tube and the mirrors. </p>
Pitcher	2 cp	5	<p>This basic clay pitcher has a handle and an open top with a groove for easy pouring. It holds 1/2 gallon of liquid. The listed weight is for a pitcher filled with water, wine, or ale; empty, it weighs about 1/2 pound.</p>
Piton	1 sp	0.5	<p>A piton is an iron spike with a loop or ring on the end so you can tie a rope to it.</p>
Poison pill ring	20 gp	0	<p>This ring has a tiny compartment under the setting, typically used to hold poison. Opening and closing a ring is a move action; doing so unseen requires a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check.</p>
Poisoning sheath	50 gp	1	<p>This scabbard contains strips of natural sea sponges on its interior. By carefully pouring a dose of poison into the empty scabbard (a full-round action), you saturate the sponges with the toxin, which keeps it viable and wet for up to 4 hours. Preparing the scabbard carries the normal risk of poisoning yourself, just like poisoning a weapon. The next weapon you draw from the scabbard is automatically poisoned as if you had directly applied poison to it (but does not risk poisoning you); this consumes the poison in the scabbard. A scabbard only fits one type of bladed weapon, such as a dagger, shortsword, or longsword. This kind of item is usually illegal in areas that outlaw poison.</p>
Pole	5 cp	8	<p>This 10-foot length of wood is useful for probing pits, flagstones, and murky liquids from a safe distance.</p>
Portable bridge	200 gp	60	<p>When staked down with eight pitons (four on each side of the gap), this rope and slat bridge can support up to 1,500 pounds and span a 30-foot gap. It rolls up into a parcel that can be carried slung over the back or by a pack animal. Convincing an animal to cross a portable bridge requires the come or heel trick.</p>
Portable ram	10 gp	20	<p>This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to break open a door and allows a second person to help, automatically increasing your bonus by +2.</p>
Pot, common	8 sp	4	<p>This 8-inch-diameter iron pot is sturdy and has feet, a lid, and a rounded handle. It can hold enough stew to feed one hungry human for one meal. A mithral pot is lighter and food rarely sticks to it.</p>
Pot, mithral	1001 gp	2	<p>This 8-inch-diameter iron pot is sturdy and has feet, a lid, and a rounded handle. It can hold enough stew to feed one hungry human for one meal. A mithral pot is lighter and food rarely sticks to it.</p>
Powder	1 cp	0.5	<p>Powdered chalk, flour, and similar materials are popular with adventurers for their utility in pinpointing invisible creatures. Throwing a bag of powder into a square is an attack against AC 5, and momentarily reveals whether an invisible creature is there. A much more effective method is to spread powder on a surface (which takes 1 full round) and look for footprints.</p>
Powder horn	3 gp	1	<p>Typically crafted from hollowed-out animal horn, but increasingly crafted from metal in a wide variety of shapes, a powder horn can hold up to 10 doses of black powder. A powder horn protects black powder stored within in it from exposure to fire, electricity, firearm misfires, and water, and the narrow end of the horn is useful in funneling the expensive powder carefully into the barrel of a firearm.</p>
Prosthetic (arm)	10 gp	3	<p>People who lose hands, arms, legs, or feet in combat sometimes replace them with prosthetics: realistic simulations of their missing limbs. Usually carved of wood and painted to match the wearer's skin tone, these items have limited functionality, allowing a legless person to walk at half speed, or enabling an armless person to hold a shield in a fixed position, but little more. Clever individuals have been known to create small compartments in their prosthetics, just large enough to hold very small objects. A prosthetic hand or foot can hold an item with negligible weight, while a prosthetic limb can hold up to 1 or 2 pounds.</p>

You use the key's Disable Device bonus of +10 rather than your own total; you cannot take 10 when using a skeleton key. The key only gets one roll for any particular lock. If the roll fails, the key is unable to open or close that lock. Inferior skeleton keys may only have a +5 bonus. </p>
Skillet, common	8 sp	4	<p>This 8-inch-diameter skillet has a long handle and feet so you can rest it on a fire or hot coals.

Snorkel, common	5 sp	0	<p>This waterproof wooden tube has a curved end with a mouthpiece. When you hold the mouthpiece in your mouth, the tube extends past your face and toward the back of your head, allowing you to breathe indefinitely when swimming facedown or barely submerged. If you submerge the tip of the snorkel, it floods with water and can't be used to breathe until you clear the water from it (requiring a move action and full access to air). A typical snorkel's length is about 15 inches; any shorter than this and it tends to fill with water when you swim, but any longer and you're not moving enough fresh air through the snorkel to be effective. </p><p><i>Masterwork Snorkel</i>: This snorkel has a valve at the top to keep out of the water, keeping it from being flooded from splashes or when you submerge. It also has a sump and valve near your mouth, preventing water from reaching your mouth and automatically draining excess water when you surface.</p>

Stilts, common	2 sp	10	<p>This item consists of a pair of wooden poles with a footrest halfway up. By standing on the footrests and holding the tops of the poles you can avoid certain ground-based threats to your feet. For example, you can use stilts to cross water without getting wet, but you would still activate a trap that triggers when you walk in a certain area. Using stilts reduces your base speed from 30 feet to 20 feet, or from 20 feet to 15 feet. You can hop off your stilts as a move action, or as a free action with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. </p><p>You must use both your hands to walk with stilts. Walking with stilts requires a DC 5 Acrobatics check for each move. Failing this check means you do not move for that move action; failing by 5 or more means you fall off the stilts. If you want to use one hand for something else while standing on stilts, you must succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check or lose the action; if you want to use two hands, the DC increases to 20. </p><p>Stilts for a Medium creature raise you 2 feet above the ground; stilts for a Small creature raise you 1 foot from the ground. You can use taller stilts, but each additional foot of elevation increases the Acrobatics DCs of using stilts by +5. A stilt has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. If you only have one stilt, your speed drops to 5 feet because you can only hop rather than walk. </p><p><i>Masterwork Stilts</i>: These stilts strap to your feet and legs, allowing you to use your hands for other tasks without penalty. Walking on masterwork stilts requires a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Attaching or removing a masterwork stilt is a full-round action.</p>

A torch does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage.</p><p> </p>
Traveler's dictionary	50 gp	2	<p>Each of these books references a specific language and has two sections. The first presents a wide variety of useful phrases and words in Common (arranged by category) followed by a phonetic representation of the same in the language that the book deals with. The second section provides an alphabetical (by phonetic spelling) collection of words and phrases in the second language and their approximate Common translation. Using this book does not grant a bonus on rolls to communicate, but at the GM's discretion it can negate or reduce a penalty if the other creature is patient enough to wait for the translation. </p>

Water clock	1000 gp	200	<p>This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurately to within half an hour per day since it was last set. It requires a source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the regulated flow of droplets of water.</p>
Waterproof bag	5 sp	0.5	<p>This leather sack sealed with tar or pitch keeps delicate items from being ruined by water. Items kept inside remain relatively dry, making the bag ideal for carrying maps, scrolls, spellbooks, and the like, although the bag is not impervious and can only be completely immersed for 10 rounds before enough water seeps in to ruin such items. </p>
Waterproof lantern	5 gp	0	<p>Meant to shelter its flame from both water and wind, this lantern treats severe winds as strong winds, windstorms as severe winds, and hurricanes as windstorms for the purpose of determining whether they extinguish its flame.

Weapon cord	1 sp	0	<p>Weapon cords are 2-foot-long leather straps that attach your weapon to your wrist. If you drop your weapon or are disarmed, you can recover it as a swift action, and it never moves any farther away from you than an adjacent square. However, you cannot switch to a different weapon without first untying the cord (a full-round action) or cutting it (a move action or an attack, hardness 0, 0 hit points). Unlike with a locked gauntlet, you can still use a hand with a weapon cord, though a dangling weapon may interfere with finer actions. </p>
Whetstone	2 cp	1	<p>A whetstone allows you to sharpen a blade by sliding it against the stone at a precise angle.
