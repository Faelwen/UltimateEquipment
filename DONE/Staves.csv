All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot spread. All creatures and objects within 2 squares of the broken staff take an amount of damage equal to 20 - the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 15 - the number of charges, and those 5 or 6 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 10 - the number of charges. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.</p><p>The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence (01-50 on a d%), but if she does not, the explosive release of spell energy instantly destroys her. Only certain items, including the <i>staff of the magi</i> and the <i>staff of power</i>, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.</p>	117,500 gp, craft magic arms and armor, craft staff, cone of cold, continual flame, heightened fireball, globe of invulnerability, hold monster, levitate, heightened lightning bolt, magic missile, heightened ray of enfeeblement, wall of force	strong varies
