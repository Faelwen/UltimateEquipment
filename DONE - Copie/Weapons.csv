Simple	Unarmed Attacks	Unarmed strike		1d2	1d3	×2			Bludgeoning	Nonlethal	<p>An unarmed strike is an attack such as a punch or a kick where the attacker is not using a weapon to make the attack. A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes at his discretion. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.</p><p>An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike. Unarmed strikes do not count as natural weapons (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 182). An unarmed strike can't be disarmed.</p>
Simple	Light Melee 	Battle aspergillum	5 gp	1d4	1d6	×2		4	Bludgeoning	See text	<p>Named for the common aspergillum, a macelike tool used by priests to sprinkle holy water, this light mace has a hollow head and a metal plug closing off the hole through which the head is filled. When the mace strikes a creature, holy water sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout the weapon's head; creatures subject to damage from holy water take 1 point of damage in addition to the normal effect of being struck by the mace (a nonmagical aspergillum can deal holy water damage to an incorporeal creature in this manner, even if the mace itself deals no damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be refilled. Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity (like drinking a potion). A filled aspergillum is normally carried upright, to prevent the holy water from leaking out as the weapon moves.</p>
Simple	Light Melee 	Brass knuckles	1 gp	1d2	1d3	×2		1	Bludgeoning	Monk, see text	<p>These weapons fit snugly around the knuckles and allow you to deal lethal damage with an unarmed strike.

Monks are proficient with brass knuckles. Brass knuckles can't be disarmed.</p>
Simple	Light Melee 	Cestus	5 gp	1d3	1d4	19-20/×2		1	Bludgeoning or piercing	Monk, see text	<p>The cestus is a glove of leather or thick cloth that covers the wielder from mid-finger to mid-forearm. The close combat weapon is reinforced with metal plates over the fingers and often lined with wicked spikes along the backs of the hands and wrists. While wearing a cestus, you are considered armed and your unarmed attacks deal lethal damage. If you are proficient with a cestus, you can have your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning or piercing damage. Monks are proficient with the cestus. When using a cestus, your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry items in that hand, but the constriction of the weapon at your knuckles gives you a –2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving that hand (such as opening locks). A cestus can't be disarmed.</p>
Simple	Light Melee 	Dagger	2 gp	1d3	1d4	19-20/×2	10	1	Piercing or slashing		"<p>A dagger is a fighting knife.

Its blade can be either smooth or serrated, and some fighting sickles are sharpened on both sides near the point, making it easier to hook into an opponent's flesh.</p>
Simple	Light Melee 	Spiked gauntlet	5 gp	1d3	1d4	×2		1	Piercing		<p>This is a gauntlet of thick leather or metal with blades or spikes protruding from above the knuckles, allowing the wearer to stab with the force of a punch.

Simple	Ranged 	Heavy crossbow	50 gp	1d8	1d10	19-20/×2	120	8	Piercing		<p>You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A heavy crossbow fires crossbow bolts.</p><p>Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a –4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
Simple	Ranged 	Javelin	1 gp	1d4	1d6	×2	30	2	Piercing		<p>A javelin is a thin throwing spear . Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a –4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.</p>

You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
Simple	Ranged 	Sling		1d3	1d4	×2	50		Bludgeoning		<p>A sling is little more than a leather cup attached to a pair of strings. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.</p><p>A sling fires sling bullets. You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
Simple	Ranged 	Underwater heavy crossbow	100 gp	1d8	1d10	19-20/×2	120	8	Piercing		<p>Above water, this weapon is identical to a heavy crossbow.

Martial	Light Melee 	Butterfly sword (2)	20 gp	1d3	1d4	19-20/×2		1	Slashing	Monk	<p>These short matching swords come in pairs, cleverly nested together to appear as a single blade. Both weapons can be drawn at the same time, and they can be separated as a free action and wielded in both hands to make wickedly effective chops and slashes. Their thin, broad blades extend just 1 foot in length. A butterfly sword has a hardwood grip covered with braided cord, and a metal D-shaped guard to protect the wielder's hand. The listed price is for a pair of butterfly swords. Masterwork butterfly swords cost 320 gp for the pair. If you add magical enhancement bonuses or properties to a butterfly sword, treat each sword in the pair as a separate weapon (for example, adding a +1 magical enhancement bonus to a pair of masterwork butterfly swords costs 4,000 gp).</p>
Martial	Light Melee 	Dogslicer	8 gp	1d4	1d6	19-20/×2		1	Slashing	Fragile	<p>This short, curved blade was created by goblins, who often drill numerous holes into it in an attempt to reduce its weight. Most dogslicers are sized for Small creatures.</p>

Martial	Light Melee 	Jutte	8 gp	1d4	1d6	×2		1	Bludgeoning	Disarm, monk	<p>This batonlike weapon is fitted with a metal hook that can be used to block and pin an opponent's weapon. Some variations are tipped with a sharpened metal spike or blade.</p>
Martial	Light Melee 	Kerambit	2 gp	1d2	1d3	×3			Slashing		<p>This small, curved pull dagger has a metal loop at the base of its handle, allowing it to be secured with a pinky or worn on a string tied in the hair.

Martial	Light Melee 	Shortsword	10 gp	1d4	1d6	19-20/×2		2	Piercing		<p>Short swords are some of the most common weapons found in any martial society, and thus designs are extremely varied, depending on the region and creator.

Martial	Light Melee 	Starknife	24 gp	1d3	1d4	×3	20	3	Piercing		<p>From a central metal ring, four tapering metal blades extend from this weapon like points on a compass rose. By gripping the crossbar that runs through the weapon's open middle, a wielder can strike with it as a deadly melee weapon. Alternatively, by gripping it by the outer rim, a starknife's light, aerodynamic design allows it to be thrown short distances in a manner similar to a chakram.</p>
Martial	Light Melee 	Throwing axe	8 gp	1d4	1d6	×2	10	2	Slashing		<p>This one-handed axe is small and perfectly balanced for throwing, and can be used as a melee weapon.

Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Double chicken saber	12 gp	1d4	1d6	19-20/×2		3	Slashing	Disarm, monk	<p>The tip of this 3-foot-long, straight-bladed sword is bent into two staggered, opposing sharpened spurs that can be used to pull weapons from an opponent's hands.</p>

Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Light flail	8 gp	1d6	1d8	×2		5	Bludgeoning	Disarm, trip	<p>A light flail consists of a weighted striking end connected to a handle by a sturdy chain. Though often imagined as a ball, sometimes spiked like the head of a morningstar, the head of a light flail can actually take many different shapes, such as short bars.

Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Longsword	15 gp	1d6	1d8	19-20/×2		4	Slashing		<p>This sword is about 3-1/2 feet in length.</p>

The scizore grants a +1 shield bonus to AC, but if you attack with the blade, you lose the AC bonus that round and take a –1 penalty on attack rolls with it. While wearing a scizore, you cannot use that hand for anything else. A scizore provides a +10 bonus to your CMD against being disarmed of your scizore. Donning a scizore is a full-round action.</p>
Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Sibat	2 gp	1d4	1d6	×3	10	2	Piercing or slashing	Grapple	<p>This weapon is similar to a shortspear with a flexible rattan or bamboo shaft and an elaborately barbed head. The barbs can snag flesh, clothing, or armor to ensnare an enemy.</p>

Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Sword cane	45 gp	1d4	1d6	×2		4	Piercing		<p>This slender light blade lies within a wooden container that serves as both its scabbard and hiding place. You can draw the blade as a swift action (or a free action if you have the Quick Draw feat). An observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to realize an undrawn sword cane is a weapon rather than a walking stick; the DC decreases to 10 if the observer is able to handle the weapon. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a sword cane sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. You can't wield a sword cane in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to damage.</p>

Martial	One-Handed Melee 	Warhammer	12 gp	1d6	1d8	×3		5	Bludgeoning		<p>This weapon consists of a wooden haft and a heavy, metal head. The head may be single (like a carpenter's hammer) or double (like a sledgehammer). The haft is long enough that you may wield it one- or two-handed. Though heavy and relatively slow to wield, warhammers are capable of delivering immense blows, crushing armor and flesh alike.</p>
Martial	Two-Handed Melee 	Bardiche	13 gp	1d8	1d10	19-20/×2		14	Slashing	Brace, reach, see text	<p>The crescent axe-blade of this polearm is attached to the haft at two points: the center of the blade attaches to a socket at the top of the haft, and the lower point of the blade attaches to a secondary mount point.

Martial	Two-Handed Melee 	Earth breaker	40 gp	1d10	2d6	×3		14	Bludgeoning		<p>The crude metal of this massive hammer's head ends in multiple blunt spikes that help concentrate the force of a powerful swing down into a smaller, more focused area, allowing it to smash through armor with greater ease. Due to the tremendous size and weight of its head, an earth breaker is poorly balanced, and requires two hands to properly lift and control.</p>
Martial	Two-Handed Melee 	Falchion	75 gp	1d6	2d4	18-20/×2		8	Slashing		<p>This sword has one curved, sharp edge like a scimitar, with the back edge unsharpened and either flat or slightly curved. Its weight is greater toward the end, making it better for chopping rather than stabbing.</p>

Martial	Two-Handed Melee 	Greataxe	20 gp	1d10	1d12	×3		12	Slashing		"<p>This two-handed battle axe is heavy enough that you can't wield it with one hand. The head may have one blade or two, and may be ""bearded"" (meaning hooked or trailing at the bottom) to increase cleaving power and help pull down enemy shields. The haft is usually 3 to 4 feet long.</p>"
Martial	Two-Handed Melee 	Greatclub	5 gp	1d8	1d10	×2		8	Bludgeoning		<p>This larger, bulkier version of the common club is heavy enough that you can't wield it with one hand.

Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Chain spear	15 gp	1d4/1d4	1d6/1d6	×2		13	Piercing and slashing	Trip	<p>This vicious weapon is often used in gladiatorial events due to its versatility. The body of the weapon is a standard short spear, primarily used for thrusting. The butt of the spear is fitted with a length of chain, often spiked, with a hook at the end. The hook and chain may be used to make trip attacks. If your trip attack fails by 10 or more, you may drop the chain spear to avoid being knocked prone.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Dire flail	90 gp	1d6/1d6	1d8/1d8	×2		10	Bludgeoning	Disarm, double, trip	<p>A dire flail consists of two spheres of spiked iron dangling from chains at opposite ends of a long haft. This weapon excels at short but powerful strikes, and is typically swung in a constant churning motion. The wielder of a dire flail must have great strength, both to use the weapon effectively and to keep from tiring out.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Double walking stick katana	50 gp	1d4/1d4	1d6/1d6	×3		6	Bludgeoning	Double	<p>This single case conceals a pair of matched fighting swords perfectly balanced to be wielded as a pair. Despite their name, the blades more closely resemble the shorter wakizashi. When the blades are concealed in their case, this weapon can be used as a quarterstaff.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Double-chained kama	8 gp	1d4/1d4	1d6/1d6	×2		4	Slashing	Double, monk, reach, trip	<p>This weapon comprises a pair of kama connected with an 8-foot length of chain. The wielder can attack as if armed with a single kama in each hand or extend the chain to make a single reach attack. By swinging the chain, the wielder can whip the kama about to disarm or trip opponents. Furthermore, if one of the weapons is dropped, the wielder can retrieve it as a free action by pulling on the chain.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Dwarven urgrosh	50 gp	1d6/1d4	1d8/1d6	×3		12	Piercing or slashing	Brace, double	<p>A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon—an axe head and a spear point on opposite ends of a long haft. The urgrosh's axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon; the other becomes the off-hand weapon. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage. Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Elven curve blade	80 gp	1d8	1d10	18-20/×2		7	Slashing		<p>Essentially a longer version of a scimitar, but with a thinner blade, the elven curve blade is exceptionally rare. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to your CMD whenever a foe attempts to sunder your elven curve blade because of its flexible metal.</p><p>You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with an elven curve blade that is sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Flying blade	40 gp	1d10	1d12	×3		12	Slashing	Performance, reach	<p>A flying blade is a large, crescent-shaped blade anchored to a 10-foot chain. You fight with a flying blade by spinning it about your head or by snapping it toward an opponent. Because the flying blade is a clumsy weapon, you receive a –2 penalty on attack rolls with it, but when you make attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, you receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls instead of the penalty.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Gnome hooked hammer	20 gp	1d6/1d4	1d8/1d6	×3/×4		6	Bludgeoning or piercing	Double, trip	<p>A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon—an ingenious tool with a hammer head at one end of its haft and a long, curved pick at the other. The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (critical multiplier ×3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (critical multiplier ×4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. Gnomes treat hooked hammers as martial weapons.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Harpoon	5 gp	1d6	1d8	×3	10	16	Piercing	Grapple, see text	<p>A harpoon is a barbed spear with an attached rope 50 feet or less in length. Most harpoons have metal points, but some use ivory or are made entirely of wood. If you are proficient with the harpoon, it is a grappling weapon. A harpoon's weight includes 10 pounds for the weight of 50 feet of hemp rope. The weight can be reduced by using shorter or lighter rope. If you are not proficient with a harpoon, treat it like a spear.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Kusarigama	12 gp	1d2/1d4	1d3/1d6	×2		3	Slashing or bludgeoning	Double, grapple, monk, reach, trip	<p>This weapon has a single kama or sickle held in the off hand, attached by 10 feet of fine chain to a weighted metal ball. The sickle can be used to make trip attacks, jabs, and blocks, while the ball is whipped around at high speeds and then smashed into the opponent, or used to tangle an opponent's sword or spear, allowing the wielder to then attack with the sickle.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Kyoketsu shoge	6 gp	1d3	1d4	×2	20	1	Slashing or piercing	Disarm, grapple, monk, reach	<p>This weapon consists of a foot-long double-edged blade, with another smaller, curved hook-blade sticking out the side like a rooster's spur. The blade is strung to a large iron hoop with a 10-foot length of rope. The blade can be used as an off-handed melee weapon or thrown like a dagger, while the rope and circlet can be whipped around and swung at opponents as a bludgeoning reach weapon.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Mancatcher	15 gp	1	1d2			10	Piercing	Reach, see text	<p>This polearm consists of two curved metal bands that close around a target when you attack, allowing you to bind an opponent. A mancatcher is built to capture a creature of a particular size category (such as Small or Medium) and doesn't work on creatures of the wrong size. Make a touch attack to hit an opponent and a combat maneuver check to grapple him (without the –4 penalty for not having two hands free); success means you and the target are grappled. Once the target is grappled, you can perform a move or damage grapple action against him. The mancatcher has hardness 10 and 5 hit points; breaking it requires a DC 26 Strength check. If you drop the mancatcher, the target can free himself as a standard action.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Meteor hammer	10 gp	1d6	1d8	×2		10	Bludgeoning	Reach, trip	<p>This weapon consists of one or two spherical weights attached by a 10-foot chain. You whirl the weights and wrap them around an opponent's body. If you succeed at a trip attempt with a meteor hammer, you can drag your opponent 5 feet closer to you rather than knocking her prone. You may use this weapon in two different ways: In meteor mode you use it as a double weapon, while in fortress mode you cannot use it as a double weapon but gain reach and a +1 shield bonus to AC. Switching between these two modes is a free action decided at the start of your turn.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Orc double axe	60 gp	1d6/1d6	1d8/1d8	×3		15	Slashing	Double	<p>A cruel weapon with blades placed at opposite ends of a long haft, an orc double axe is a double weapon. Though invented by and traditionally associated with orcs, the double axe can be crafted and wielded by other races as well, though many disdain it for its extreme weight and clumsiness. Because of the blades at either end of the axe, the wielder must hold an orc double axe in the middle of its haft, and utilize a weaving, slashing fighting style more akin to that of a quarterstaff than to that of a greataxe or battleaxe.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Seven-branched sword	50 gp	1d8	1d10	×3		7	Slashing	Disarm, monk	<p>This unusual sword has a straight 2-foot-long blade with six shorter L-shaped blades protruding from it, three on each side in a staggered pattern. The shorter blades can be used to snag opponents' clothing or armor, or can target weapons in order to disarm them. To snag armor or clothing, the attacker makes a trip attempt. If successful, the victim doesn't fall prone, but instead is snagged and stumbles forward, leaving the victim flat-footed for the remainder of the round.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Spiked chain	25 gp	1d6	2d4	×2		10	Piercing	Disarm, trip	<p>A spiked chain is about 4 feet in length and covered in wicked barbs. Some have metal hoops to use as handgrips. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Tetsubo	20 gp	1d8	1d10	×4		10	Bludgeoning		<p>A slight improvement over the greatclub, this weapon consists of a long, slender length of wood or metal whose upper half is shod with a thick sheet of studded iron. The iron gives added weight and strength to the club, while the studs are designed to crack helmets and armor.</p>
Exotic	Two-Handed Melee 	Two-bladed sword	100 gp	1d6/1d6	1d8/1d8	19-20/×2		10	Slashing	Double	<p> A two-bladed sword is a double weapon—twin blades extend from either side of a central, short haft, allowing the wielder to attack with graceful but deadly flourishes.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Bolas	5 gp	1d3	1d4	×2	10	2	Bludgeoning	Nonlethal, trip	<p>A bolas is a pair of wooden, stone, or metal weights connected by a thin rope or cord. You can whirl and throw this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a bolas.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Boomerang	3 gp	1d4	1d6	×2	30	3	Bludgeoning	See text	<p>The boomerang is primarily a hunting tool, but it is not uncommon for these versatile thrown weapons to be carried into battle. A boomerang is made of wood and is flat, with a long haft, a pronounced forward curve, and a sharp backward bend at the head. A hunting boomerang does not fly in a returning path.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Double crossbow	300 gp	1d6	1d8	19-20/×2	80	18	Piercing	See text	<p>This heavy weapon fires a pair of iron-tipped bolts with a single squeeze of the trigger. Because of its size and weight, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll if you're proficient with it, or –8 if you're not. If the attack hits, the target takes damage from both bolts. Critical hits, sneak attack damage, and other precision-based damage apply to only the first bolt. Reloading one bolt is a standard action; the Rapid Reload feat reduces this to a move action. Crossbow Mastery allows you to reload both bolts as a move action. A double crossbow fires crossbow bolts.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Halfling sling staff	20 gp	1d6	1d8	×3	80	3	Bludgeoning		<p>Made from a specially designed sling attached to a short club, a halfling sling staff can be used by a proficient wielder to devastating effect. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a halfling sling staff, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a halfling sling staff with one hand. Loading a halfling sling staff is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.</p><p>A halfling sling staff fires bullets. You can hurl ordinary stones with a halfling sling staff, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls.</p><p>A halfling sling staff can be used as a simple weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size. Halflings treat halfling sling staves as martial weapons.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Hand crossbow	100 gp	1d3	1d4	19-20/×2	30	2	Piercing		<p>You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A hand crossbow fires standard crossbow bolts, like those used by light and heavy crossbows.</p><p>You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Kestros	1 gp	1d6	1d8	×3	50	1	Piercing		<p>The kestros is an oddly shaped Bronze Age sling used for launching kestros darts. Your Strength modifier applies on damage rolls when you use a kestros, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire—but not load—a kestros with one hand. Loading a kestros is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. Halflings treat the kestros as a martial weapon.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Lasso	1 sp					5		See text	<p>This thrown weapon is a length of rope with a simple open knot on one end that allows you entangle a foe like you would using a net. The DC to cast a spell while entangled with a lasso is 10 + the spell level being cast. An entangled creature can slip free with a successful DC 15 Escape Artist check as a full-round action. The lasso has 2 hit points and AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to break it. On a successful hit, the lasso tightens; to use it again you must spend a standard action sliding the knot to enlarge the loop.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Net	20 gp				10	6		See text	<p>A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net's maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed at a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell.</p><p>An entangled creature can escape with a successful DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a successful DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action). A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.</p><p>A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Repeating hand crossbow	800 gp	1d3	1d4	19-20/×2	30	4	Piercing		<p>This weapon functions identically to a repeating heavy crossbow, except its damage, critical, and range values are equivalent to those of a hand crossbow instead.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Repeating heavy crossbow	400 gp	1d8	1d10	19-20/×2	120	12	Piercing		<p>The repeating heavy crossbow holds 5 repeating crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p><p>You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Repeating light crossbow	250 gp	1d6	1d8	19-20/×2	80	6	Piercing		<p>This weapon functions identically to a repeating heavy crossbow, except that its damage, critical, and range values are equivalent to those of a light crossbow instead of a heavy crossbow. Its significantly lighter construction and pull make it both more portable and more useful to those who rely on stealth or speed.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Rope dart	1 gp	1d3	1d4	×2	20		Piercing	Blocking, distracting, monk	<p>This deceptively complex weapon appears to be nothing more than a 12-foot rope attached to a 6-inch-long, conical metal spike. Similar to a meteor hammer, it can be whirled at great speeds, then aimed to strike and pierce opponents with great reach. Once it strikes, the wielder can quickly retrieve the weapon with a tug of the rope as a free action.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Shuriken (5)	1 gp	1	1d2	×2	10	0.5	Piercing	Monk	<p>A shuriken is a small piece of metal with sharpened edges, designed for throwing. A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon. Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them and crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and of what happens to them after they are thrown.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Snag net	30 gp				10	10	Piercing	Trip, see text	<p>This short, wide net is covered in barbed loops and slipknots. It works like a typical net, except it has the trip weapon special feature. If you entangle an opponent and hold the trailing rope, on your turn in place of a melee attack you may make a combat maneuver check to trip against that opponent; if you succeed, you may trip your opponent or deal 1 point of piercing damage to it. The concentration DC to cast while entangled in a snag net is 17 + the spell's level. The Escape Artist DC to escape a snag net is 22.</p>
Exotic	Ranged 	Throwing shield	+50 gp	1d4	1d6	×2	20		Bludgeoning	Performance, trip	<p>This shield is designed for throwing and has specially designed straps that allow you to unclasp and throw it as a free action. Tower shields cannot be throwing shields. Neither a shield's enhancement bonus to AC nor its shield spikes apply on your attack or damage rolls. A throwing shield can't be disarmed.</p>
Firearm	One-Handed Melee; Early	Buckler gun	750 gp	1d4	1d6	×4	10	6	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>The front of this buckler is fitted with a small, double-barreled gun that can be shot while wearing the buckler. Unlike with a double-barreled pistol, you can shoot only one barrel at a time. You must remove the buckler to reload the gun. Each barrel of a buckler gun uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. Because of its awkward construction, a buckler gun is always considered an off-handed weapon. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	One-Handed Melee; Early	Coat pistol	750 gp	1d3	1d4	×3	10	1	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>Though less powerful than other, larger firearms, this pistol is small enough to be easily concealed in a jacket or coat. You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a coat pistol on your body. A coat pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	One-Handed Melee; Early	Dagger pistol	740 gp	1d3	1d4	×3	10	1	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>A combination of a coat pistol and a blade, the dagger pistol can be used as both weapons. The awkwardness of the configuration means you do not gain the bonus on Sleight of Hand checks that either of those stand-alone weapons grants. The dagger pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the dagger component are considered broken. A dagger pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	One-Handed Melee; Early	Double-barreled pistol	1750 gp	1d6	1d8	×4	20	5	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>This pistol has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be fired independently as a separate action, or both can be shot at once with the same action. If both barrels are shot at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and the pistol becomes wildly inaccurate, imposing a –4 penalty on each shot. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	One-Handed Melee; Early	Dragon pistol	1000 gp	1d4	1d6	×4	20	3	Bludgeoning and piercing	Scatter	<p>Like a miniature blunderbuss, the dragon pistol fires pellets or a bullet from its flared barrel. The dragon pistol fires in a 15-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. A dragon pistol uses either a bullet or group of pellets and 1 dose of black powder, or a single alchemical cartridge (with either bullets or pellets) as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	One-Handed Melee; Early	Pepperbox	3000 gp	1d6	1d8	×4	20	5	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>This pistol has six barrels instead of one. The entire barrel housing can be quickly rotated by hand between shots (a free action requiring one free hand), allowing all six bullets to be fired before the weapon must be reloaded. Each barrel of a pepperbox uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	One-Handed Melee; Early	Pistol	1000 gp	1d6	1d8	×4	20	4	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>The basic single-shot pistol is one of the most common firearms, although in most campaigns it is still rare enough to be an object of envy or curiosity to most. As such, it can take a variety of different forms, from wildly ornate masterpieces in the shape of fire-breathing dragons to the more common wood-handled pistols, or nothing more than a simple metal tube with a triggering device.</p><p>A pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	One-Handed Melee; Early	Sword cane pistol	775 gp	1d3	1d4	×3	10	1	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>A combination weapon, this gun mixes a coat pistol with a sword cane. The sword cane pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. The pistol attachment makes the nature of the weapon a little more difficult to hide. An observer must succeed at a DC 15 Perception check to realize that an undrawn sword cane pistol is a weapon rather than a simple walking stick; the DC decreases to 5 if the observer is able to handle the weapon. A sword cane pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. The sword part of the weapon must be drawn in order to load the pistol part of the weapon. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Early	Axe musket	1600 gp	1d6	1d8	×4	30	6	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>This short musket features an axe blade at the end of its barrel. It can be used as both a musket and a battleaxe. It is considered a double weapon for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the axe are considered broken. An axe musket uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Early	Blunderbuss	2000 gp	1d6	1d8	×2	15	8	Bludgeoning and piercing	Scatter	<p>This weapon fires pellets or a bullet from its trumpet-shaped barrel, making it an effective fowling weapon or close-fighting personal defense weapon. The blunderbuss fires in a 15-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. A blunderbuss uses a bullet or pellets and a single dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Early	Culverin	4000 gp	2d6	2d8	×4	30	40	Bludgeoning and piercing	Scatter	<p>The culverin, also known as a hand bombard, consists of a simple smoothbore tube, sealed at one end except for a small hole used to ignite a gunpowder charge. A wooden stock partially encases the barrel, allowing you to hold it under your arm with relative ease when carrying it. Firing a culverin without support (such as a wall, a window, or a stand) imposes a –4 penalty on attack rolls, and knocks you prone. A culverin uses 4 doses of black powder and grapeshot (a handful of pellets) as ammunition. Note that these statistics simulate only the original, hand-held culverins—their larger descendants are considered cannons and are dealt with in the siege weapon section of <i>Ultimate Combat</i>. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Early	Double hackbut	4000 gp	2d10	2d12	×4	50	18	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>This double-length rifle uses a pair of trunnions to mount its barrel into a swiveling mechanism fastened to the top of a lightweight, two-wheeled carriage. It takes a full-round action to set up the carriage. The carriage has a hind leg, allowing the wielder to wheel the device about and immediately prop it for stability during combat. Unlike other two-handed firearms, you must fire the double hackbut while it is mounted, or else firing it imparts a –4 penalty on attack rolls and the recoil knocks you prone. A Large or larger creature can fire a double hackbut one size smaller than itself without the gun's mounting as a normal two-handed weapon and without the danger of being knocked prone, but takes the normal penalty for firing an inappropriately sized weapon. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Early	Double-barreled musket	2500 gp	1d10	1d12	×4	10	11	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>This musket has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be shot independently as a separate action, or both can be fired at once as the same attack. If both barrels are fired at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and the gun becomes wildly inaccurate, taking a –4 penalty on each shot. Each barrel of a double-barreled musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Early	Fire lance	25 gp	1d4	1d6	×4	10	4	Piercing		<p>This primitive firearm is merely a long tube that, when ignited, propels forth a short gout of flame and a javelin. Unlike other firearms, the fire lance is wildly imprecise, and targets AC rather than touch AC. A fire lance is always treated as having the broken condition for the purpose of determining the effects of a misfire. A fire lance uses a javelin and 2 doses of black powder as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Early	Musket	1500 gp	1d10	1d12	×4	40	9	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>This long-barreled firearm has a much greater range than a pistol. A musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as its ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Early	Warhammer musket	1600 gp	1d6	1d8	×4	30	6	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>This musket has a warhammer head at the end of its barrel, which allows it to be used as both a musket and a warhammer. It is considered a double weapon for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the warhammer are considered broken. A warhammer musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>
Firearm	One-Handed Ranged; Advanced	Revolver	4000 gp	1d6	1d8	×4	20	4	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>A revolver is a pistol with a revolving cylinder containing six chambers. Each chamber can hold a metal cartridge, and when one cartridge is fired, the cylinder automatically rotates (no extra hand or action required), readying the next chamber for firing. A revolver uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Advanced	Double-barreled shotgun	7000 gp	1d6	1d8	×2	20	15	Bludgeoning and piercing	Scatter	<p>This twin-barreled shotgun can be shot one barrel at a time, or both together as one attack. A double shot that fires bullets is inaccurate, and takes a –4 penalty on both attacks. A double shot that fires bullets targets only a single creature and increases the damage of each barrel to 2d6 points (Small) or 2d8 points (Medium) for a total of 4d6 or 4d8 points of damage. A double-barreled shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or pellets) as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Advanced	Pepperbox rifle	7000 gp	1d8	1d10	×4	80	15	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>The four barrels of this rifle are set into a turnable housing that can be quickly rotated by hand (a free action) between shots. A pepperbox rifle uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Advanced	Rifle	5000 gp	1d8	1d10	×4	80	12	Bludgeoning and piercing		<p>This improvement on the musket features a grooved barrel that imparts a twisting, spiral motion to the bullet as it exits, stabilizing it and preventing the end-over-end tumbling common to projectiles from simpler firearms. As a result, a rifle can fire significantly farther and with more accuracy than early long-bore firearms.</p><p>A rifle uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.</p>
Firearm	Two-Handed Ranged; Advanced	Shotgun	5000 gp	1d6	1d8	×2	20	12	Bludgeoning and piercing	Scatter	<p>This advanced version of the blunderbuss shoots in a 30-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 20-foot range increment when firing a bullet (often called a slug). Shotguns can either be simple and functional, or art pieces in their own right, with engravings and inlay on the stocks and breeches. Those used by the upper class are often emblazoned with images of game animals, family crests, or elaborate maker's marks.</p><p>A shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or pellets) as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.</p>
Ammunition		Arrows (20)	1 gp					3			<p>An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier ×2). Arrows come in a leather quiver that holds 20 arrows.</p>
Ammunition		Atlatl dart	1 gp					2			<p>An atlatl dart is the equivalent of a javelin except it has fletching. If thrown without an atlatl, treat it as a javelin.</p>
Ammunition		Bamboo shaft arrows (10)	1 gp					0.5			<p>These foot-long arrows are used as ammunition for arrow tubes. As an improvised melee weapon, they deal damage equivalent to that of a spiked gauntlet. They come in a bamboo tube that holds 10 shafts.</p>
Ammunition		Blowgun darts (10)	5 sp								<p>The thin, light darts used in a blowgun are usually made of hardwood with a stabilizing fletching of down or fur. A dart is usually loaded from the back end just before firing.</p>
Ammunition		Blunt arrows (20)	2 gp					3			<p>These arrows have rounded wooden tips that deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing. An archer can use a blunt arrow to deal nonlethal damage (at the normal –4 attack penalty for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage).</p>
Ammunition		Crossbow bolts (10)	1 gp					1			"<p>A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier ×2). Bolts come in a case or quiver that holds 10 bolts. All crossbows except repeating crossbows use these kinds of crossbow bolts, which are sometimes called ""quarrels.""</p>"
Ammunition		Flight arrows (20)	2 gp					3			<p>These arrows have light shafts and special fletching to give them greater range. A flight arrow's range increment is 20 feet greater with longbows and 10 feet greater with shortbows. They deal damage as if one size category smaller.</p>
Ammunition		Kestros dart (10)	5 gp					5			<p>This dart, meant to be thrown using a kestros, consists of a heavy metal point about 9 inches long attached to a shaft of wood about 12 inches long, fletched with feathers for stability. If used as a melee weapon, it is a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier ×2). Kestros darts come in a quiver that holds 10 darts.</p>
Ammunition		Repeating crossbow bolts (5)	1 gp					1			<p>Bolts for a repeating crossbow are designed to fit the bolt case of a repeating crossbow. They are slightly more expensive than regular crossbow bolts and sold in increments of 5 instead of 10 (to match the capacity of the bolt case).</p>
Ammunition		Sling bullets (10)	1 sp					5			<p>Sling bullets are shaped metal balls, designed to be used by a sling or halfling sling staff. Bullets come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets.</p>
Ammunition		Smoke arrow	10 gp								<p>This arrow is actually a specially-shaped smokestick that can be fired from a bow. It trails smoke as it flies, and creates a 5-foot cube of smoke where it strikes. It otherwise functions like a normal arrow in terms of damage, range, and so on.</p>
Ammunition		Whistling arrows (20)	2 gp					3			<p>These arrows come with specially designed grooves and fletching that cause them to emit a loud keening sound audible within 500 feet of their flight path. They are sold in quantities of 20.</p>
Firearm ammunition		Alchemical cartridge (dragon's breath)	40 gp								<p>An alchemical cartridge is a prepared bundle of black powder with a bullet or pellets, sometimes with more exotic material added, which is then wrapped in paper or cloth and sealed with beeswax, lard, or tallow. There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge—a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.</p><p><i>Dragon's Breath Cartridge</i>: This cartridge contains alchemical compounds that, when fired, produce a cone of fire instead of the normal attack of a one-handed or two-handed firearm with the scatter weapon quality. The nonmagical flame deals 2d6 points of fire damage to all targets within the cone of the scatter firearm (DC 15 Reflex save for half). These cartridges cannot be used in firearms that don't have the scatter weapon quality. Because this ammunition forces a saving throw instead of making an attack roll, the misfire rules are slightly different. If you roll a 1 with either of the damage dice, the firearm misfires.</p><p><i>Entangling Shot Cartridge</i>: This mix of black powder and an alchemically treated resin strong enough to survive the shot can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or another scatter weapon. It deals half damage to those hit by a cone attack made with this weapon, but any creature hit by the shot must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or become entangled for 2d4 rounds. An entangling shot cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 2.</p><p><i>Flare Cartridge</i>: When a flare cartridge hits its target, it deals only half the normal damage, but the creature struck is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 reduces this to dazzled), and creatures within a 20-foot burst are dazzled for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates the effect). Flare cartridges are also useful for sending up signal flares. Firing a flare cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 2 unless it is fired from a blunderbuss or a dragon pistol, in which case doing so only increases the firearm's misfire value by 1. Flares can be used only to attack single creatures; they do not work as a shot for a scatter weapon's cone attack.</p><p><i>Paper Cartridge</i>: This simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet increases the misfire value by 1.</p><p><i>Salt Shot Cartridge</i>: This mix of black powder and rock salt can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or other scatter weapon. It deals nonlethal instead of lethal damage, and increases the misfire value by 1. You can use it only with a scatter weapon's cone attack.</p>

Firearm ammunition		Black powder (dose)	10 gp								<p>Black powder is the key explosive component within a firearm that enables it to function, but in larger amounts this alchemical material can be quite destructive on its own as well. A single dose of black powder is enough to power a single shot from most one-handed and two-handed firearms, while 10 doses are required to fire a cannon. Black powder is often stored and transported in kegs (which hold 100 doses), but in this quantity the powder itself becomes dangerous. Exposure to fire, electricity, or a misfire explosion causes black powder to explode—a single keg that explodes in this manner deals 5d6 points of fire damage to anyone within a 20-foot burst (DC 15 Reflex half). Storing black powder in a powder horn protects the powder from explosion.</p>

Firearm ammunition		Firearm bullet (1)	1 gp								<p>The ammunition of most one-handed and two-handed firearms, firearm bullets typically take the form of small balls of lead or some other metal. Thirty bullets weigh half a pound.</p>
Firearm ammunition		Metal cartridge	15 gp								<p>These sturdier versions of alchemical cartridges serve as the ammunition for advanced firearms. They can hold either bullets or pellets.</p>
Firearm ammunition		Pellets (handful)	1 gp								<p>A handful of pellets, along with 1 dose of black powder, is commonly used as ammunition for one-handed and two-handed firearms with the scatter weapon quality, though rocks or other small bits of hard material can be used in the pellets' place. Using anything other than pellets or alchemical cartridges when firing off a cone attack with a scatter weapon increases the weapon's misfire range by 1 (though this increase can be removed by switching back to standard ammunition). Thirty handfuls of pellets weigh half a pound.</p>
Firearm ammunition		Pitted bullet	5 gp								<p>This ammunition is pitted with a pattern of small pocks into which specially formulated poison compounds can be applied. A poison compound is a derivative of a standard toxin that is alchemically reduced to a solid form. These can be made from any standard injury or contact poison with a successful Craft (poison) check equal to the poison's DC + 4. The cost of purchasing an already prepared poison compound for the purpose of treating pitted bullets is equal to the poison's base cost + 20 gp. Once crafted, the compound can be pasted into the ammunition's pitted design and allowed to harden. Upon completion, the bullet can be fired from an appropriate firearm, releasing the poison compound into its target upon impact, but the poison's DC is reduced by 2. A pitted bullet cannot be used with an alchemical cartridge. The listed cost does not include the cost of poison.</p>
